            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Be thou gentle, or ungentle, I will tell thee my faults, and accuſe my ſelfe; which ſometimes findeth more love, than ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love doth. In erring, there are divers degrees; and there is a difference betweene a deviation, a digresſion, and a divagation: a deviation may be but a little way off, like the exorbitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of a wheele out of the wonted tract, or roade, though ſtill running on in the high way; every Writer thus erreth oftentimes: And there may be a digresſion, which is a fetching of a remoter compaſſe, either for neceſsitie, or delight; as to ſee ſome fenced Caſtle, or royall Court, or ſome excellent Monument; which being viewed, men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to their old way: this is not much diſcommendable, ſithence few men write, without uſing this libertie: But a Divagation is of larger extent, and, in effect, may be compared to the trayling of an Hare, and, after he is ſtarted, to the purſuing of him, in all his wily turne-abouts, and doubles, over hills, over dales, thorow buſhes, buyers, and thornes, till he be quite tired. I could not avoyd, but uſe frequently many Deviations, and divers times, ſome digresſions. The third ſort, namely, Divagations, I uſe onely on great occaſions; if that be a fault, I yeeld, and confeſſe it; yet let one ſay truly, I doe no where expatiate; but if thou follow me, thou wilt finde ſome pleaſure; and I doubt not of good mens approbation, when in queſt and ſearch after truth, J follow a Papiſt, as <hi>Pererius</hi> was; or a ſtiffe Opinionist, and over-rigid Lutheran, as <hi>Illyricus</hi> was, and follow cloſe to the heeles the enemies of Truth, which way ſoever they take, ſithence the inveſtigation of Truth, is a more refined Recreation, and of a more ſpirituall refreſhment, than the deceiving, ſenſuall, and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary ſports or pleaſures can be. For all this, if thy nature cannot brooke with ſuch extravagancies, skip cleane over them.</p>

And yet, good Reader, I have a greater fault.

But againſt their reaſon it is obſervable, that they were not confined to any ſhort time, but might take leaſure enough with mature deliberation, before they choſe their paſſeover, and at the choyce of it: Beſides, the Sacrifice was to be choſen, on the tenth day of the firſt Moneth,<note n="l" place="margin">Exod. 12 3.</note>

                           <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> that they feared them not, nor cared to diſpleaſe them, by ſetting aſide, ſo long before hand, thoſe Kids, and eſpecially Lambes, for to be ſacrificed and eaten, which the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> could not abide to be ſlaine, much leſſe to be eaten; for this was abhomination to them, becauſe they worſhipped them as Gods, there being no ſuch occaſion in future times, they needed not to ſtore up their Lambes <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>3</label> foure dayes before the Sacrifice. Thirdly, that they might have faire time to ſeach and examine, if there were any manner of legall defect, inward or outward, growne <label type="milestone">

So many Lambes or Kids, and thoſe every way perfect, were not preſently to be found, and then the Apollyon or exterminating Angell would have puniſhed their defect. Fifthly, that the preſence of the Lambe <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>5</label> for foure dayes might miniſter unto them diſcourſe of Gods great favour to them, by the meanes of that paſſeover freeing them from the death of their firſt-borne, and giving them this as a ſacred earneſt of their delivery from captivitie, and vaſſalage in <hi>Aegypt.</hi> Sixtly, what the Jewes wanted, they were permitted by God to borrow <label type="milestone">

And though the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> had light, where they dwelt, yet the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> ſaw not one another, neither roſe any from his place for three dayes<note n="o" place="margin">Exod. 10.23</note> 
                           <hi>Exod.</hi> 10.23. neither doe I thinke, that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had beene able to ſee to chooſe Lambes or Kids, if they had gone into the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Territories, where one might feele darkeneſſe, or darkeneſſe might be felt,<note place="margin">Exod. 10.21.</note> 
                           <hi>Exod.</hi> 10.21. Therefore they muſt needes, and did provide the Lambes and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47497:39"/>Kids foure dayes before hand. Seventhly, to put them in minde, that as they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided themſelves for a departure, ſo it was to an holy departure, <label type="milestone">

                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>8</label> Laſtly, the Lambe was to bee choſen, and as it were in their ſight for foure dayes, perhaps to ſignifie either that Chriſt was publikely to be ſeene, knowne, made manifeſt by his open workes of his miniſtery, about foure yeares, e're he was offered up (a day being ſet for a yeare in Scripture phraſe) or elſe to fore-ſignifie that Chriſt ſhould come foure dayes to <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> before the paſſion; and ſo he did when they cryed <hi>Hoſanna,</hi> as if they had found the perfect Sacrifice; their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer being in ſight, and welcomed with the extraordinary applauſe of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, that went before, and that followed after,<note n="p" place="margin">Matth. 21.9.</note>

                        <p>THe third Argument is this; Chriſt kept the Law exactly; but Chriſt, and his Apoſtles did lye downe at the eating of the paſſeover, in the night of his betraying; and therefore the Law of the firſt paſſeover was, that the Iewes ſhould eat it, lying on their beds?

I hope they had no graſſe growing in an upper Chamber. I hope there is a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the thouſands of Diſciples, and his twelve Legates <hi>â latere,</hi> his moſt holy Apoſtles: divers actions are fitted to divers places: and <hi>Clemens</hi> addeth, Chriſt asked water out of the <hi>Samaritans</hi> earthen water-pot, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.7. diſtinct people, diſtinct places; diſtinct occaſions muſt not be indiſtinctly huddled together, and falſely applyed onely to Chriſts laſt Supper. And yet I muſt needes declare for my part: I judge it farre more probable that they did ſit, than that they did lye downe at this firſt Paſſeover. Firſt, for that the Paſſeover was to be eaten in haſte; but ſitting is a geſture more accommoded for haſte, than the manner of diſcumbing was, or could be: Secondly, ſitting at Feaſts was before this time in uſe; the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> (ſate) before him, at a feaſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 43.33. which cuſtome of ſitting we muſt not thinke was introductory, but explanatory, it was not onely then uſed becauſe onely then expreſſed; but this poſture or geſture, did declare the Common practiſe of them, in thoſe times. Thirdly, ſitting was in uſe by the ſame Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall people, who are the Paſſeover; For the Iſraelites, even almoſt as ſoone as they were gone out of Aegypt, at the Feaſt of the golden Calfe; I ſay, the people (ſate downe) to eate, and to drinke, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.6.

                        <p>BUt I will not determine, that they did (ſit) at the Paſſeover; firſt, becauſe it is no where ſo expreſſed: Secondly, becauſe they were to have their ſtaffe in their hand; and this was (as I may ſo call it) a running banquet; a ſpeedy ſacrifice; where delay was dangerous, and haſte commanded.

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:47497:48"/>this was in alluſion to the eating of the Paſſeover; as by divers other particulars beſide ſtanding, it appeares, though it may be anſwered: firſt, that there is no allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Iſraelites, in ſome particulars there expreſſed; nor is it likely, that the Iewes had Breſt-plates, ſhield, helmet, and ſword; at leaſt, not all of theſe; which the Apoſtle wiſheth in the ſpirituall <hi>panoplia,</hi> generally.</item>
                              <item>2. If the Apoſtle had his Principall alluſion to that place, or cuſtome; yet <hi>Symbolica Theologia non eſt argumentativa,</hi> an argument from a <hi>ſimile</hi> is no good Divinity, but ſaith <hi>Corneli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Cornelii â lapide, Apoſtolus ſanè huc</hi> (<hi>i.</hi> to the Iſraelites geſture) <hi>alluſiſſe, velpotiùs Allegoricum bujus loci ſenſum dediſſe videtur:</hi> Surely, the Apoſtle ſeemeth to have alluded hither; or rather, to have given the Allegoricall meaning of this place.</item>
                              <item>3. It ſeemeth that S. <hi>Paul</hi> putteth the Chriſtian Souldier, into the poſture, not of a Traveller, or a moving, journying, way-faring man; as the eaters of the Lambe were to be, and were: but of an armed, prepared, Centinell, watchman, or Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, or combatant, bound to keepe his place, and not to goe away, or ſhew his back (as the Iſraelites did) for there is no Armour for the backe in all that ſpirituall Armorie: but all is as for a Combatant, or warriour, who is to bee ſpiritually as well furniſhed as the defendant is in the liſts, bodily.</item>
                           </list> My ſecond reaſon is becauſe their ſtaves were in their hands; what needed fitting men have ſtaves in their hands? and they were to goe forth in haſte; but men are readier to goe, when they ſtand, than when they ſit: and they were to eate it in haſte, but haſty meales are commonly made by people ſtanding, rather than ſitting: ſitting imployeth ſome continuance, therefore in all likelihood, they ſate not but ſtood: and yet who peremptorily concludes, that the Iſraelites (ſtood), becauſe they were ſhod, girded, and had a ſtaffe, doe not enough conſider that our gallants in times of peace, in the middeſt of eaſe, and Court-glory, doe ſit at meate, booted, and ſpurr'd, ſome perhaps girt with a ſword, when they intend no journying. <hi>Barradius</hi> thinkes it credible that the Iſraelites did (ſit) at the Paſſeover in Aegypt, with ſtaves in their hands; which I hold not ſo credible. The third reaſon is this the Maſter ſits down to meate, the Servant makes ready ſupper, girdeth himſelfe and ſerveth, <hi>Luk</hi> 17.7.8. but the Iſraelites were now ſervants, and made ready the Paſſeover, and waited for a ſignall of departure, and therefore ſate not in eaſe, but (ſtood) in expectancie. Fourthly, they had packed up their houſholdſtuffe, and perhaps that houſhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuffe, on which they would otherwiſe have ſate, even their kneading-troughs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bound up in their cloathes, upon their ſhoulders, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.34. and the Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians were urgent upon the people, that they might ſend them out of the Land in haſte, <hi>ver.</hi> 38. and the Iſraelites were thruſt out of Aegypt, and could not tarry, <hi>ver.</hi> 39. theſe places prove a buſie ſtirring, and removall, rather than a repoſed ſitting, either at or after meate. Fiftly, ſome ſay Chriſt (ſtood) at the eating of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall lambe, and therefore at the firſt, the Iſraelites are it (ſtanding:) but a man may anſwere, <hi>argumentum claudicat utroque poplite,</hi> is lame in both knees, is divers wayes awry; neither will any be able to proove that Chriſt and his Apoſtles are it (ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding;) neither, if they did (ſtand) will it follow that ſuch was the geſture of the praecedent Paſſeovers; but rather of the Paſſeover, at that time. Beſides, as at the Aegyptian Paſſeover, it is more likely that they did (ſit) than (lye downe,) and ſtood rather than ſit: ſo, at our Saviours laſt Paſſeover, when wee come to it, it will appeare that it is leaſt probable, that he and his Apoſtles did (ſtand;) probable, that they did (lye downe) more probable, that they did (ſit) moſt probable, that Chriſt did ſtand adminiſtring; and both he and they (kneele) at the receiving of the Sacred Euchariſt. Nor was our Saviour tyed to the entire conformity, with the firſt Paſſeover: none of theſe Arguments (we ſee) are demonſtrative; but muſt be caſt into the number of the probable ones.</p>

                        <p>ANd thus, I doe reckon them up in order, as they were uſed, though not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, in the order preſcribed. 1. They were to chuſe a Lambe for that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice: I determined before, that at the firſt Paſſeover, it might be either Lambe, or Kid; and I hold it probable, that in caſes of neceſſitie, when there were not Lambs ſufficient, they might follow the firſt precedent; and rather than they ſhould want a Sacrifice, the Kid ſhould be (<hi>uccedaneall,</hi> and ſupply the Lambs ſtead; a Lambe rather than a Kid; a Kid rather than none: Againe, when there were ſtore of Lambs, yet Kids alſo might be offered; offered, I ſay, as other Paſchall offerings to make up the ſacred Feſtivall, which continued ſeven dayes; not as the proper paſchall offerings, being the ſubſtance of their great Sacrament, and the Type of ours; the Kids might be the boyled offerings, not the roſted; or, if roſted, not roſted in the beginning of the Feaſt, on the fourteenth day of the firſt moneth; or if then they were roſted; they might not be, they were not, the Paſchall offerings; whoſe bones muſt not be broken, whoſe remainder muſt be burnt with fire before mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: for, as I before, from the Iewiſh conſent, and practiſe, declared, generally, and in the intent of the Law; though Kids might be uſed in neceſſitie, and want of Lambs, yet onely the flocke, not any of the herds, muſt ſend forth that burnt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; and among the flocks a Lambe, not a Kid muſt be the proper Paſchall Sacrifice.</p>

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:47497:52"/>her; as a foyle, adding more luſtre to a precious ſtone, and not a blemiſh: the ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes forbidden, in the Prieſts, or offerings, were blemiſhes tending to defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie: the Roman noſe; the Auſtrian lip, are highly honoured; unſpottedneſſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth freedome from any ill-blemiſhes, excludeth not change of colours; ſpotted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe implyeth a (remarkeable) imperfection; damneth not a gracefull decorum: yea, nor things of a middle Nature, or indifferent middeſſes, betweene deformity, and faireneſſe; perfection and imperfection. A Lambe (broken) in any part, a weake, ſickely, poore, or ſhorne Lambe, was the ſpotted or blemiſhed Lambe, in the eye of the Law, though the colour of it were all white: and the perfect Lambe both inwardly, and outwardly was the unblemiſhed Paſſeover, according to the ſtrict Law, though the wooll and skin were parti-coloured.</p>

                        <p>THe third objection is; our Saviour was adumbrated by the Paſchall Lambe moſt ſignificantly? What of that? But Chriſt was without all ſhadow of imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection? True, nothing truer; therefore the Paſcall Lambe muſt be likewiſe? I anſwere, the moſt ſignificant ceremonies were not in all, and every <hi>puncto</hi> like; likeneſſe in every minuteſt <hi>Re, aut Reculâ,</hi> differeth not much from ſelfe-ſameneſſe; it was enough for the Type to be without any reall deformity, or ill-blemiſh; but ſuch a blemiſh as ſeemes a blemiſh to ſome, and not ſo to others, is not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the Lambe, or Paſchall offering, for even the ſubſtance it ſelfe, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly immaculate Lambe of God, was thus blemiſhed, and many wayes blemiſhed; his eating with Publicans, and ſinners was (eſteemed) as a blemiſh or fault, <hi>Mar.</hi> 2.16. He was worſe blemiſhed, when they ſayd, <hi>Mar.</hi> 11.19. he was a glutton, and a wine-bibber: and yet none of thoſe, were true blemiſhes; but divine condeſcents heavenly favours, and moſt faire fruites of unſpotted humility, and communicated charity: So, in an under degree of compariſon, (without diſparagement to our moſt glorious Saviour) the parti-coloured Lambe, for the Paſchall offering, might be thought blemiſhed, by ſome; and yet indeed not truely blemiſhed; Chriſt are ſuch an unſpotted Lambe; offered himſelfe, an unſpotted Sacrificer, an unſpotted Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</p>

So much be ſayd to diſtinguiſh what blemiſhes, or ſpots, were accepted, what rejected; and that a Lambe with a <hi>petite,</hi> or reputed ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, might be; and an ill-blemiſhed, ſpotted Lambe, might not be the roſted Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall offering.</p>

                        <p>MY reaſons are; Firſt, a Lambe, at nine dayes old, is no good meate; it is like a Chicke in the Egge-ſhell; the fleſh is rather ſlime, and uncocted gelly, than ſubſtantiall food; and the bones rather tender griſtles, than firme, hard, bones; but God would not preſcribe unwholeſome greene meate in his moſt ſolemne feaſts; yea, did not: againe a Lambe but of nine dayes old, when it is roſted, is but a poore roſt: Two men may eaſily eate that up; yea, one man with a good ſtomacke; if the unſavorineſſe of the food doe not turne his ſtomacke; but the Paſſeover was to be provided to ſerve a whole houſhold, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.13. and if the houſhold be too little for the Lambe; it was to be food for two houſholds, <hi>ver.</hi> 4.

The next objection is; in <hi>Iſaac ſhall thy ſeed be called,</hi> that is, called to be more bleſſed, more holy, more preferred, more proſperous in this world, more beneficiall to others, for the world to come; from <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and his ſeed ſhall Chriſt come; yet Chriſt came of <hi>Ruth</hi> the <hi>Moabiteſſe,</hi> who was of the ſeed of <hi>Lot;</hi> I know not that ever he came from any <hi>Iſhmaelite;</hi> the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. interprets thus; he ſayth not, unto ſeeds as of many, but as of one; <hi>and to thy ſeed,</hi> which is Chriſt.

The points which concerned publique Religion are almoſt wholly loſt; it may be the latter Romans dealt with the Lawes of their devout <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma;</hi> and with part of the <hi>Ius Papirianum;</hi> as the former Romanes did, with thoſe bookes of <hi>Numa;</hi> which they found buried by himſelfe; and being taken up, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers hundred yeares after his death; when they were informed that they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordant from the then profeſſed Religion, they burned them. If they had beene kept tranſcribed and publiſhed; I confeſſe, I had rather have ſeene them, then all the Triumphall monuments, that ever were brought into the Capitoll. It may be they periſhed, when Rome was ſacked; wherefore you may not expect a Totall confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the firſt Table of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law; yet obſerve ſomë remnants tending that way: <hi>Cicero</hi> (<hi>de devinat.</hi> lib. 1.) <hi>Romulus</hi> made a Law, that noe man ſhould be uſhered into the throne either of Kings, or Magiſtrates, but by Heavenly appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation. <hi>Cicero</hi> (2. <hi>de leg.</hi>) hath divers Lawes touching Religion (it is likely from <hi>Numa</hi>) <hi>ſeparatim nemo habeſſit Deos, neve novos, ſive advenas, niſi publicè ad-ſcitos, privatim colunto;</hi> let not any man deify new gods, or ſtrange gods; nor pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately worſhip any, but thoſe publiquely received.

                        <p>Secondly, the Sabbatarians, unto their forced expoſitions, invent lyes that they may further their ſeeming devotions; but God needs not mans lye to uphold his truth.

Againe, when the Ruler of the Synagogue anſwered with indignation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt healed one, on the Sabbath day, Chriſt called him hypocrite, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.25. confuting him, by his owne, and their generall practiſe; <hi>Doth not each one of you on the Sabbath, looſe his Oxe, or his Aſſe from the Stall, and lead him away to wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring?</hi> Obſerve firſt, nor Oxe, nor Aſſe can take much hurt, if they be not wrought, though they drinke not, from Sun-riſing. to Sun-ſet; yet for covetouſneſſe, or for pitty, they did looſe them: Secondly, they might have looſed them, though them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had not led them away, to the watering places; for Nature teacheth beaſts to know their drinking places; but they would (lead) them away thither, which they needed not; and being done for lucre, was certainely a breach of the Sabbath. And <hi>Iohn</hi> 7.22. The Iewes did on the Sabbath day, circumciſe a man, about which they uſed many Ceremonies, of preparation, of abſciſſion, of waſhing, of ſtopping the blood, and applying of ſalves to heale the would; though it were but one lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle part, to be wounded, and made whole; and are ye angry with me, ſaith Chriſt, becauſe I have made a man every whit whole on the Sabbath day?

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:47497:62"/>beene a greater ſin, to obſerve it: the Ceremoniall Law was languiſhing all Chriſts life; was dead, at Chriſts death, in moſt things; but after his Reſurrection, and the promulgation of the Goſpell was deadly. The next Sabbath day of the Iewiſh Church, not after Chriſts death immediatly; yet after the Lords day was conſecrated, by Chriſts Reſurrection; was the firſt Sabbath, that was needleſſely kept, and continued: and now the Apoſtle, in the ſame place to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> is bold to inferre, that no man ſhould judge them, in reſpect of an holy day, or New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moones, or of the Sabbath dayes, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. And if any had judged of them amiſſe, they neede not to eſteeme it: and in all the Apoſtolicall Writings, is no incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to obſerve the Sabbaths any longer, but the Lords day; which Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe chalked out unto us, by his oftner appearing on that day, than on the Iewiſh Sabbaths: yea, but S. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 9.29. called God the Lord of Sabbath; it ſhould be read <hi>Sabaoth,</hi> and the Apoſtle quoteth it, from <hi>Eſay</hi> 1.9.

Firſt therefore let us prove that they did ſo. Secondly, let us ſhew the reaſons why they did ſo: <hi>Origen</hi> ſideth with <hi>Tertullian</hi> in giving no reaſon why they did ſo; yet ſaith, they did ſo; and we muſt needes doe ſo, (<hi>in lib.

Thirdly, God placed <hi>Eden</hi> in the Eaſt, and caſt out man to the Weſt; therefore deſiring our old habitation, and ſighing for it, towards it we worſhip. 4. <hi>Moſes</hi> his Tabernacle had the vayle, and propitiatory on the Eaſt; and the Tribe of <hi>Iudah</hi> as the moſt honourable Tribe, encamped on the Eaſt; and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:47497:64"/>in the moſt famous Temple of <hi>Salomon,</hi> the Porch was towards the Eaſt. 5. Chriſt being Crucified looked towards the Weſt; and we in fervent deſire, ſighing after him, worſhip towards him; Chriſt in his aſſumption aſcended toward the Eaſt; and ſo his Apoſtles worſhipped him; and ſo ſhall he deſcend to the laſt judgement, at his ſecond comming; for <hi>Act.</hi> 1.11. <hi>This ſame Ieſus, which is taken up from you into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſhall ſo come (in like manner) as you have ſeene him going into Heaven;</hi> ſay the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Angels; and this they learned from Chriſt himſelfe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.27. <hi>As the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning commeth out of the Eaſt, and ſhineth even unto the Weſt; (ſo) ſhall alſo the comming of the ſonne of man be:</hi> If it be objected ſpeciouſly, that it is to be underſtood, <hi>de modo, non de ſitu, &amp; poſitione corporis?</hi> Firſt, I anſwere, I onely cited <hi>Damaſcen's</hi> argument. Secondly, <hi>in mode, ſitus, &amp; poſitio Corporis poteſt intelligi.</hi> Thirdly, the unuſuall, doubled phraſes, ſhall ſo come, and in like manner, point out variety of matter, in the manner, for I thinke not fit, to exclude the manner, nor his aſcent to the Eaſt. 4. <hi>Situs corporis</hi> may be underſtood two wayes; either, <hi>pro poſitione cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris quieſcentis;</hi> this the Text doth not meane; or, <hi>propoſitionis corporis moti, vel mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventis ſeſe;</hi> and of this poſture is the Text to be interpreted; for Chriſt, in his body ſhall come from the Eaſt, toward the Weſt. 6. <hi>Damaſcen</hi> acknowledgeth, there is no expreſſe command in Scripture, to pray or worſhip toward the Eaſt; by ſaying it is an Apoſtolicall tradition: and an unwritten Apoſtolicall Tradition (if it be ſo certainely) binds us as well, as if it were written: ſee moſt of theſe pointsampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the learned <hi>Clitchtovaeus,</hi> upon <hi>Damaſcene:</hi> Concerning the two laſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Damaſcene,</hi> which <hi>Clitchtovaeus</hi> wholly omitteth, I will onely ſay this, omitting many things: that our dead are buried with their feere toward the Eaſt, that at the Reſurrection their faces may be that way prepared, as it were to behold the glorious ſecond comming of our Saviour, ſo much expected, ſo much deſired: Thus much be ſpoken in defence of Chriſtians praying toward the Eaſt; which may be done at many fit times; and fitly though we officiate the Liturgie, at the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the Communion Table.</p>
                        <p>From whence likewiſe the Canonicall appointment of the Commandements, to be ſet on the Eaſt-end of every Church, and Chappell; and the placing of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion Table, (our woodden Altars) our Sacred boords toward the Eaſt exactly (as the Propitiatory was, in the old Law) is juſtly defended; and found anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Primitive uſance; Henceforth let that blaſpheunous Gentile, ſtocke, or ſtone, who ſeeing a moſt reverend, holy, and learned Biſhop, at his entrance into the Church, decently to bend, ſtoope, and doe reverence to God alone, toward the Eaſt, where the memoriall is, of the holieſt of holies; and where Chriſt is really ſpiritually, moſt ineffably preſent at, and in our Sacrament: I ſay, let him (who ſayd in a mocke, that he could finde in his heart, to goe to leape-frogge, over that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Prelate) know his abominable pride, confeſſe his blaſphemie, and repent for his Atheiſticall in devotions: likewiſe that idle buſie-body, that irreformable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former, who not onely pryeth too boldly into the Arke; but hath ſucked in moſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous hatred, and mightily laboured to ſpread his poyſon againſt our Church, and Church-Prelates, the upholders under our gracious King of our Arke, yea and againſt his Sacred Majeſtie. I ſay, <hi>Naviget Anticyres,</hi> let him take Hellebore, and purge himſelfe throughly firſt; and recant his wicked errours; his greaſie and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly compariſon; that the ſtanding of our holy Table, cloſe to the inſide of the Eaſt, of our Chancell, is like a Butchers boord, or a dreffer in the Kitchin: Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, and jeering at the beſt, is but the froth, and ſome of a ſcurrilous wit; of an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious ſhallow braine, which never was acquainted with the true inward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and joy of the holy Ghoſt; and therefore breakes out like ſcabs from a corrupt body, into outward, uncomely, and ſcandalous making of ſport; whilſt the mocker is mocked at, many times, moſt bitterly, and fiercely. Laſtly, let thoſe ſuper-nice people, who becauſe we are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to ſtand at the north-ſide of Table, do take excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at the placing of the Eaſt-ſide of the Lords Table, cloſe to the Eaſt-wall, within the Chancell; I ſay, let them goe to ſchoole, and be better catechized, and know
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:47497:64"/>what reverence, in the moſt holy dayes, next to the times Apoſtolicall, was uſed toward the Eaſt: oh conſider, ſay they, by the Rubricke of our Liturgie eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by Act of Parliament we are appointed to ſtand, on the North ſide; but as our late directions runne; we cannot ſtand on the North-(ſide) but on the North-(end) of the boord; if the Eaſt-ſide of it doe touch the Eaſt-wall of the Chancell: ſuch is their oppoſition. I anſwere, to the point thus.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. We, the Obedient ſonnes of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> doe no wayes infringe that Divine Liturgie, which our Church-men did frame; and they our Martyrs ſealed with their blood; which Royall authority directed and eſtabliſhed; which Parliaments yeelded unto and confirmed.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. In how many other points, the giddy-ſeeming-preciſe ones, doe little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme of Princes, Parliaments, or Church; let their omiſſion of prayers appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; their jeering contempt at the holy Liturgie, and their writing againſt it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.</p>

                        <p>Fourthly, I doubt not, but all the Altars erected by holy men in Scripture, were foure-ſquare: I am ſure, there were but two ſtanding laſting Altars allowed; either in the time of the Tabernacle or of the Temple; and both of them were to be, and were exactly foure-ſquare: <hi>The Altar of the burnt-offering ſhall be five Cubits long and five Cubits broad; the Altar ſhall be foure-ſquare,</hi> Exod. 27.1. <hi>And a Cubit ſhall be the length of the Altar of Incenſe; and a Cubit, the breadth thereof, foure-ſquare ſhall it be; Exod.</hi> 30.2.

Admirable was that their Law, <hi>Rei furtivae aeterna authorit as eſto;</hi> at any time, from any man, I may challenge, and take, what was ſtollen from me; yea, though the poſſeſſor had lawfully, and for good conſideration, bought it from the thiefe. The manner of ſearching after things ſtollen, was better, and more rationall, than any practiſe, we uſe; which as ſome malicious villaine hath beene found, to bring ſecretly into his enemies houſe, the thing reported to be ſtolne, and ſought for; and himſelfe to droppe it downe ſlily in ſome corner there, that others might finde it; and ſo the ſuſpected one might be found guilty. <hi>Dioxip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi> that noble Champion, or Fencer, was little better uſed by the the envious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedones, in <hi>Curtius</hi> (9. <hi>pag.</hi> 303. for, purpoſely they ſtole away a golden Cup from a Feaſt, and accuſed him to the King; <hi>Dioxippus</hi> could not abide to be held, by <hi>Alexander,</hi> or his envious enemies, as a thiefe, and killed himſelfe.

If any one ſhould prudently, cautelouſly, and lovingly adviſe me to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine; whether, in every of the other Commandements, the (Intention) of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, be not a violation?

The Iewes called ſtrangers, Sojourners, or Proſelytes, within their Covenant; and obedient to the Iewiſh Law, Righteous ſtrangers: of holy ſtrangers, and converts was our Chriſtian Church alſo compounded; the Iewes did compaſſe ſea and land to make one Proſelyte; and yet (that people may feare without good cauſes, to change the Religion, in which they were bred) what ſayth Chriſt? <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.15. <hi>Ye make him twofold more the child of hell than your ſelves.</hi> Devoute Proſelytes came and dweit at <hi>Hieruſalem, Act.</hi> 2.5. and 10. <hi>verſes, Act.</hi> 13.43. Religious Proſelytes follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas:</hi> this is confirmed, <hi>Eſay</hi> 14.1. <hi>The ſtrangers ſhall be joyned with Iſrael, and they ſhall cleave to the houſe of Iſrael;</hi> yea the very ſons of ſtrangers have Gods gracious promiſe, <hi>Eſay</hi> 56.3. <hi>Let not the ſonne of the ſtranger, that hath joyned himſelfe to the Lord, ſay, the Lord hath utterly ſeparated us from his people:</hi> the devoute ſons of the ſtranger within the Covenant, God will bring to his holy mountaines, and make them joyfull, in his houſe of prayer; the burnt offerings, and ſacrifices ſhall be accepted upon Gods Altar, <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. Thus doe I paſſe from the deſcribed ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſorts of ſervants, as likewiſe of ſtrangers, and cloſe up all for the reconciling of theſe ſeeming contradictions muſtered up in the front of this Chapter, by obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving two points of moment.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Firſt, what indulgence ſoever is granted, what grace offered, what favour permitted, it is onely to ſuch, as were circumciſed; the proofe reacheth home, <hi>No uncircumciſed perſon ſhall eate thereof, Exod.</hi> 12.48. And the very approbatory pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts containe ſo much; the ſervant bought with money may eate the Paſſeover,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:47497:68"/>when he is circumciſed; and the ſojourning ſtranger, when all his Males be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, he may keepe it, as is above cited. Thus the negative Precepts; <hi>No ſtranger ſhall eate thereof; a forraigner, an hired ſervant ſhall not eate thereof;</hi> all theſe, and if there be more, muſt be underſtood of ſuch as are uncircumciſed: for if any of theſe had beene admitted into the boſome of the Iewiſh Church; and write their Covenant with the blood of their Circumciſion, and ſealed it with the ſeale of Gods people, then had they an intereſt in the Paſſeover.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The ſecond thing promiſed to be premiſed, is this; How ſtrict ſoever the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Law ſeemeth to carry it; that not one, but circumciſed people might eate thereof, yet neither were women circumciſed, nor yet were they excluded from ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Paſſeover: that the men <hi>Idaealitèr</hi> repreſented the women; and the women were (as I may ſo ſay) circumciſed in the men; ſee proved in my <hi>Miſcellanies:</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſecond part of the disjunction, it is true; the Paſſeover might be eaten by men alone without women; ſo was that moſt holy Paſſeover, celebrated by our moſt bleſſed Saviour, &amp; nor women, nor diſciple at large, but the Apoſtles, the 12. Apoſtles onely ate it with him: of which, God willing hereafter: that onely women by themſelves ever obſerved it, I have not read, I doe not beleeve; though the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the family ſupplied the roome of the firſt-borne; yet the priviledge of the firſt-borne, or of the Prieſt, to ſacrifice the Paſſeover, was never permitted to wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. If it be objected, that <hi>Zipporah, Exod.</hi> 4.25. circumciſed her ſoone, and might ſhe not, as well ſlay the Paſſeover? I anſwer, the difference is great; for, firſt, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> was at the point of death, and could not circumciſe him: ſecondly, it was fit, that ſhe, who in likelihood, had hindered <hi>Moſes</hi> from circumciſing him, ſhould now doe it her ſelfe: thirdly, no Expoſitor ever doubted, but all this buſineſſe was tranſlated, by the power, and direction of God, or of the Angell, both ſhewing the cauſe of Gods wrath againſt <hi>Moſes;</hi> becauſe he, who was to give the Law to others, was a breaker of the Law, given to him by <hi>Abraham,</hi> for the circumciſion; which though God forbare, whilſt <hi>Moſes</hi> continued a private man, among the Heathen; yet now, that he was governour Elect, going as it were, to be inſtalled, with the rod of God, in his hand, <hi>Cum baculo Paſtorali;</hi> leſt he ſhould give exemplary ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall by his ſinfull omiſſion; God ſent upon him, in the Inne, and by the way exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary puniſhment; and ſayd, in effect, <hi>Zipporah,</hi> thine husband ſhall die, if thou cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſe not his ſonne; whereupon of two evills, ſhe chuſe the leſſe, as ſhee appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended: fourthly, Againe, extraordinary actions are ill precedents for a common courſe; yet give me God ſo directing, I will allow a woman ſacrificing; give me a good Angell ſo adviſing, and I will commend a lay-man; as <hi>Manoah</hi> a <hi>Danite,</hi> the father of <hi>Samſon,</hi> offering a burnt-offering to the Lord, and acting the Prieſts part, <hi>Jud.</hi> 13.6. fifthly, and laſtly, there were many, who were circumciſed, that are not the Poſſeover; as the ſeed of <hi>Eſau,</hi> but none might eate the Paſſeover, except the circumciſed: therefore, I am (perſwaded) he ſhould not heretically erre, that ſaith, as in our Sacrament of Entrance into the Church, upon great exigents, the Laity may Baptize, though Regularly it belong to the Prieſts office: ſo the Iewiſh Sacrament of Circumciſion, in extremity, might be performed by others, though the adminiſtration thereof properly appertained to the firſt-borne, head of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, or Prieſt. If any thinke I preſume too farre?

It is plaine, that Chriſt did eate the Paſſeover, the lawfull Paſſeover, with his Diſciples, on the fifth day of the weeke, at even; and he annexeth his Reaſon; becauſe Chriſt fulfilled the Law, which eſtabliſhed that time; but the Iewes abſtained from entring into the Judgement Hall, on the ſixt day of the weeke, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.28. that they might eate the Paſſeover, that day at even, according to the decrees of their fathers; for the Iewes, ſaith he, tooth and nayle, hold faſt the traditions of the Elders, eating the Paſſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, on the ſixt day of the weeke; or on the preparation of the Paſſeover, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.54. but tranſlating the Feaſt of the paſſeover, from the ſixt day, to the Sabbath day; which, by reaſon of the concurrence of two feaſts, is called an High Sabbath day, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.31. I will a little enlarge the arguments of <hi>Munſter.</hi> The Iewes led Chriſt, from <hi>Caiphas,</hi> unto the Hall of Judgement, and it was earely, and they themſelves went not into the Judgement Hall, leſt they ſhould be defiled, but that they might eate the paſſeover, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.28. therefore, they had not then eaten it, though Chriſt, and his Diſciples had eaten the paſſeover, the night precedent; for, after the three-fold Supper of Chriſt, Iudaicall, Ordinary, and Euchariſticall, Chriſt paſſed the brooke <hi>Cedron,</hi> entred into a Garden, was apprehended late at night; and the next morning, lead early into the Iudgement-Hall, or <hi>Pilates</hi> Houſe.

                        <p>A Third Argument may be this; when they conſulted to take Ieſus, and kill him, they ſayd, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.5. <hi>Not on the Feaſt-day, leſt there be an uproare among the people;</hi> they were ſo ſuperſtitiouſly addicted to their ſeeming-ſtrict obſervation of their Feaſts; that if they had taken, or killed any man, in ſuch a ſolemnity, it would have made an uproare, or mutiny; therefore it was told to Chriſt, as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſuall, and offenſive matter, that <hi>Pilat</hi> had mingled the <hi>Galilaeans</hi> blood with their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.1. as I conceive, theſe Relators intended to have made this bloody deed of <hi>Pilat,</hi> an occaſion of a new commotion, &amp; conſulted with Chriſt, to that end: <hi>Iudas Galilaeus, Act.</hi> 5.37. roſe up, in the dayes of Taxing; and the dayes of taxing were about the birth of our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then <hi>Judas Galilaeus</hi> ſtood up, and hee would have the free-borne of the Iewes, the ſonnes of God forſooth, to pay no tribute; though he periſhed, and all, as many as obeyed him, were diſperſed, as it there followeth; yet thoſe ſcattered ones continued, and propagated their He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall opinions, after <hi>Iudas Galilaeus,</hi> his death; and moſt eſpecially, they prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in <hi>Galilee:</hi> In the time of Chriſts publike teaching, the Phariſees laid a double trappe for Chriſt, about this point, <hi>Is it lawfull to give tribute to Caeſar, or not, Matth.</hi> 22.17. They fully ſuppoſed, he would have anſwered, yea, or no; and if hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, yea; their emiſſary-Diſciples would have taken advantage, as if Chriſt had favoured the Romanes, not the Iewes; the Prince, and not the people; and ſo might have ſtirred up the giddy people againſt him; if Chriſt had denied it, to be lawfull, to give tribute; the <hi>Herodians</hi> (whom alſo they ſent) would have ſeized on him, as an author of rebellion, as a follower of <hi>Iudas</hi> the <hi>Galilaean:</hi> but Chriſt did then moſt divinely breake their net in peeces, and eſtabliſhed the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of paying Tribute; ſo ſoone as he was borne. <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and the thrice-bleſſed Virgin did, in all likelihood, pay Taxation-money for him, as well as for
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:47497:73"/>themſelves; that <hi>Ioſeph was taxed,</hi> no man may doubt; that <hi>Mary</hi> alſo was taxed, is proved from the words, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.5. <hi>Ioſeph went up, to be taxed with Mary;</hi> for that holy Virgin was the onely daughter, which had nor brother, nor yet ſiſter, ſayth <hi>Aeuthymius</hi> on <hi>Iohn;</hi> and heire of her father, and had land by him, ſaith <hi>Lyranus,</hi> (on <hi>Luke</hi> 19.25.) and <hi>Euſebius Emiſſenus</hi> at large, in his Homily, of the Nativity of <hi>Mary.</hi> The Taxe was to be done, <hi>Capitatim,</hi> by <hi>poll;</hi> and ſo our Saviour not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. I am ſure, as by precepts, he upheld the Magiſtrates authoritie, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.17. ſo, he payd tribute for himſelfe, and for <hi>Peter,</hi> the then Repreſentative body of the Church; and rather wrought a miracle, than he would not pay Tribute, a Fiſh, after a wonderfull manner bringing money in his mouth: nor did he appeale from the judgement ſeate of <hi>Caeſar;</hi> his Apoſtle appealed unto it, and both S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> called for obedience of the people to their Magiſtrates, both Civill, and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall; but, after Chriſt, and his Apoſtles were dead, who ſigned this obedient Truth, with their blood, and oppoſed the denyers of tribute: then the <hi>Galilaean</hi> opinion of <hi>Zelotes</hi> prevayled amaine, as witneſſeth <hi>Joſephus</hi> (<hi>Antiq.</hi> 18.2.) and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine (<hi>antiq.</hi> 20.3.) and once more (<hi>De Bello Iudaico.</hi> 7.29.) inſomuch, as to that one particular amongſt others, both Iewes, and Gentiles doe aſcribe the beſieging of <hi>Hieruſalem:</hi> Now the remnant of thoſe ſcattered Mutiners, who ſometimes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed <hi>Iudas Galilaeus,</hi> in likelihood, came up to <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> to worſhip (with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions too-high ſwolne, and revolting) whom <hi>Pilat</hi> prevented, by mingling their owne blood, with their owne ſacrifices. <hi>Pilates</hi> act indeede had beene a moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly act, if he had not had moſt certaine intelligence of their reſolved rebellion: but Chriſt found no fault at all with <hi>Pilat,</hi> but confeſſing that the <hi>Galilaeans</hi> were ſinners, and great ſinners (<hi>Tertullian, ad Nationes,</hi> 1.17.) calleth Commotions, and conſpirations againſt Princes, <hi>Crimina <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>aeſaniae,</hi> frantique ſinnes) yet addeth, other <hi>Galilaeans</hi> (underſtand it, of the ſame factions) were as great ſinners; and even of themſelves, who related this prodigious act (for he knew their thoughts marching along, in all likelihood, with thoſe rebellious ones) he ſaith, <hi>Except yee repent, yee ſhall all likewiſe periſh, Luke</hi> 13.1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So much for the explanation of that miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood ſtory, and the third Argument.

                        <p>THe houre of the day, was another of the durable obſervations, belonging to the Paſſeover. It is a generall rule, <hi>Num.</hi> 9.3. <hi>Yee ſhall keepe the Paſſeover, in the appointed Seaſon:</hi> which words extend to the moneth of the yeare, to the day of the moneth, and to the houre of the day, what houre of the day, it was to be killed and eaten, is now inquirable. Concerning the firſt point, it is moſt apparent, that the Paſſeover was to be ſlaine, betweene the two Evenings, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.6. <hi>The whole Congregation ſhall kill it in the Evening,</hi> according to the Originall, it is to be read, betweene the two Evenings, in the duall number: for the clearing of which intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſie; know, that the word <hi>(Evening)</hi> is not here taken, as it is, in the firſt of <hi>Geneſis</hi> for the whole night, or the halfe of the naturall day, conſiſting of twelve houres, becauſe ſome diſtinct things are appointed to be done, in this evening, as the eating it, and ſome diſtinct things appointed to be done in the night, as the burning of the remainder, before the morning: ſo that, the Evening here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends not the whole night; yea, the two Evenings involve part of the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent day, and therefore cannot be interpreted, for the darke-halfe of the naturall day, oppoſed to the other lightſome halfe thereof: but the firſt Evening is here ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the time (towards) the Evening, when the Sunne was yet in their Horizon, though paſt its middle declination; the day being farre ſpent, and the Sun haſtening to its lodging; any time betweene three of the clocke, and ſixe, might the Lambe be ſlaine. Thus are our afternoone-devotions called <hi>

I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not agree to <hi>Maymonides;</hi> that immediatly, ſo ſoone as it was Noone, began the Evening; or, that they might kill the Paſſeover any time, after twelve of the clocke till ſixe; for he may be confuted by this; that the daily Evening Sacrifice, was alwayes ſlaine before the Paſſeover, and that ſacrifice in all tooke up about one houres time; and in their greateſt haſte, or buſineſſes, the daily Evening Sacrifice, was never offered neare high-noone; in exigents perhaps; about two of the clocke, and then, how could the ſubſequent Paſſover be ſacrificed, within a while of Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day? Secondly, the word <hi>[Evening]</hi> or the ſecond of the two Evenings, before mentioned, is uſed more properly, for that ſpace of time, which we call Twi-light. In Scripture phraſe, it is termed, the lodging of the day, <hi>Jud.</hi> 19.9. and is a min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled compound, or partaker, both of ſome light of the day departing, and of ſome darkeneſſe of the night incroaching; which Twi-light dured ſomewhat more, than an houre. Obſerveable is the place, where the Evening, and Sun-ſet are <hi>Synonyma's</hi> and of the ſame ſignification, <hi>Ioſh</hi> 10.26.27. <hi>They were hanged on the trees untill the (Evening) and at the time of the (going downe of the Sunne) they tooke them downe off the trees;</hi> and <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.6. <hi>Thou ſhalt ſacrifice the Paſſeover at Even, at the going downe of the Sunne; at the ſeaſon, that thou cameſt forth out of Aegypt,</hi> or, <hi>beganneſt to comforth out

                           </gap>, may well denote the (approach) of the Evening, from that time. Laſtly, the Hebrew phraſe, <hi>Circa ingredi ſolem,</hi> doth intimate; in my judgement, the deſcending of the Sunne; almoſt out of our ſight; or, rather the Time, about which he is entring, as it were, towards, or, into his lodging; which may well be reckoned, from the ſecond quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Sunnes declination, but cannot without violence, be extended to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the firſt quarters declining, immediatly after Noone-tide, as the Iew would have it, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.12. when the day began to weare away. Briefely, the ſlaying of the Paſſeover, was to be, betweene theſe two Evenings; not on the fourteenth day before the firſt Evening, that is, not before three in the after-noone (that had beene a breach of the Law) not after the beginning of the ſecond Evening; no, nor after ſixe of the clocke; for then they ſhould have had no time ſufficient to kill it; flay it, waſh it, diſembowell, or paunch it, dreſſe it, and roſt it, that they might have eaten it, in the appointed ſeaſon. In other termes conceive the matter thus; theſe words (betweene the two Evenings) may be taken, either <hi>Divifim,</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctim,</hi> disjoyntly, or joyntly; disjoyntly, for the two Evenings of one day, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant far aſunder: the firſt Evening beginning from the Sun-ſet of the precedent day; and ending in the firſt houre of the night ſucceeding (which evening begun the day, with the Iewes) the ſecond Evening of the ſame day beginning, about three of the clocke, in the afternoone, ending in Sun-ſet; which Sun-ſet cloſed up the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding day, and opened the Evening of the day following. Theſe words (betweene the two Evenings) are not thus meant, in this place; nor uſed for the two divided, and ſeperated Evenings of one day; but, the two Evenings are to be taken, <hi>Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctim,</hi> joyntly; namely, as the end of the laſt Evening of one day, is the beginning of the firſt Even of the next day; one Evening almoſt, if not immediately touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the other. Betweene theſe two Evenings of two ſeverall dayes, was the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over to be ſlaine, and prepared. This is the Reaſon, why the Paſſeover is ſaid to be kept, ſometimes on the fourteenth day of the moneth, ſometimes, on the Feaſt of unleavened bread; which feaſt was, in the beginning of the fifteenth day of the moneth, and not before; becauſe, the firſt Evening partaked of the fourteenth day; the ſecond Evening of the fifteenth day; like as our Evangeliſt ſaith, Chriſt was crucified, on the third houre, <hi>Marke</hi> 15.25. which <hi>Matthew,</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> imply, was about the ſixth houre, becauſe he was crucified, and hung on the Croſſe, about both thoſe two times; ſo, the Paſſeover is ſaid to be kept, both in the fourteenth, and fifteenth dayes, becauſe, betweene the laſt Evening of the fourteenth day, and the firſt Evening of the fifteenth day, it was to be killed, and prepared.</p>

                        <p>BVt whether <hi>David</hi> himſelfe recorded theſe things of himſelfe, or his Sonne <hi>Salomon</hi> related them of his Father <hi>David,</hi> and from him, is more queſtioned, then neceſſary to be knowne, or reſolved.

The 125.126.128.129.130. and others, have onely his Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſpeece, <hi>Conticum graduum,</hi> a Song of degrees; as this, the 132. hath, and yet were not <hi>Salomons.</hi> Againe, when <hi>Salomon</hi> builded ſo glorious things, and made the 127. <hi>Pſalme;</hi> it is written, in the forefront, <hi>Canticum graduum ipſi Selomon;</hi> which word, if it had beene added in this <hi>verſe,</hi> ſhould have had force, to make mee thinke, <hi>Salomon</hi> had indited this <hi>Pſalme.</hi> To the ſecond, I anſwer; the Argument is onely probable, for <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.50. It is ſaid, <hi>God ſheweth to his annointed, to</hi> David, <hi>and to his ſeed;</hi> yet <hi>David</hi> made that <hi>Pſalme.</hi> So <hi>David</hi> was the Author of the 144. <hi>Pſalme;</hi> as appeareth alſo by that inſcription; and yet, it is ſaid, in a manner, as of a third per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>God delivereth</hi> David <hi>his ſervant from the hurtfull ſword.</hi> To the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Muſculus,</hi> I anſwer, though <hi>Salomon</hi> uſe the like forme, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.41. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet he might doe it, imitating the holy words of his Father <hi>David,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> in ſome part, and a looſe off, imitated the prayer of <hi>Moſes, Num.</hi> 10.35. and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly enlarged it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.1. &amp;c. My opinion is, that <hi>David</hi> was the Author of this <hi>Pſalme;</hi> and God revealed unto him, that the eſpeciall place, which God ſo often promiſed to chuſe, was his Temple; and his Temple was to be, at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and, in ſuch a part of <hi>Hieruſalem.

Some, as polluted, were put from the Prieſthood; and the Governour told them, they ſhould not eate of the moſt holy, till there ſtood up a Prieſt, with <hi>

One of the 3.

They broke the Covenant, and therefore the bond be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and them, was now of none effect. Nor was the ſiege ended, till to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the end of <hi>September;</hi> the Temple being fired, and the people in it, on the tenth day of <hi>Auguſt;</hi> even the ſame day, that it had beene burnt once before, by the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> as <hi>Baronius</hi> collecteth from <hi>Ioſephus,</hi> the City was burned after; and mount <hi>Sion</hi> forced on the Sabbath day, being the 8. of <hi>September, A stone was not left upon a ſtone, in Hieruſalem.</hi> The ſecond point, which I obſerve is this; that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Jewes cryed fiercely, when they would have Chriſt crucified, <hi>His blood bee on us, and on our Children, Mat.</hi> 27.25. <hi>Titus,</hi> as the Jewes were taken, even five hundred a day and more, cauſed them all to be crucified: <hi>Ita ut jam ſpatium Crucibus deeſſet, &amp; corporibus Cruces;</hi> ſo that there was not roome for croſſes, nor croſſes enough for their bodies, as <hi>Ioſephus</hi> an eye-witneſſe relateth it, (<hi>de Bello Iudaico,</hi> 6.12.) Laſtly, I have either credibly heard or read, that whereas Chriſt was ſold for 30. pieces of ſilver, the Captive Jewes were ſold, 30. of them for one piece of ſilver; and more particularly, for <hi>Iudas Rupertus</hi> obſerveth, that for the 30 pieces of ſilver; which <hi>Iudas</hi> tooke to betray Chriſt, he had juſt as many Curſes Prophetically de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109.6 <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though I will not avouch, that <hi>Rupertus</hi> hitteth the exact number, or that every curſe in that <hi>Pſalme</hi> is appropriated to <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> onely, excluding all other of <hi>Davids</hi> enemies.

I am perſwaded that the poſtes of that doore were be-ſprinckled with ſome blood, for feare of the deſtroying Angell; which was not performed afterwards; and the non-Communicants might ſtay in them, and by the blood be freed from danger. Secondly, I inferre where the family was too little, or ſmall in number, the Paſſeover was not eaten in that houſe; but they are it in another houſe where there was a competent number together. <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius â Lapide,</hi> the Jeſuite, concludeth hence, <hi>Agnum non in Templo, ſed in domo immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latum eſſe;</hi> that the Lambe was not ſlaine, in the Temple, but in the houſe, both now and ever after; but I anſwere, if he reſtraine himſelfe to the moſt common, uſuall cuſtome, I hold with him; if he exclude extraordinary occaſions, and thinke
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:47497:83"/>it was never otherwiſe; he ſhall give me leave to diſſent. That theſe words, <hi>[a Lambe for an houſe]</hi> doth neceſſarily include this meaning, either that no houſe was without the ſlaying and eating of a Lambe; or that two Lambes might not bee ſlaine, and eaten in one houſe, I cannot beleeve: there were not more, than one Lambe killed or eaten in one houſe, ſome ſay. Dr. <hi>Willet,</hi> (on <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. <hi>queſt.</hi> 7.) is peremptory; there was not more than one lambe killed in one houſe; and elſewhere (on <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. <hi>queſt.</hi> 12.) in his third anſwere to an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which he otherwiſe juſtly confuteth, letteth fall theſe words, though the houſhould were never ſo great, one Lambe might ſuffice to have every one a part, it was not provided to fill their bellies, ît was lawfull for them afterward, to eate o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meate, it was preſcribed to be uſed as a Sacramentall commemoration of their deliverance; and ſo to be a food, rather for their ſoules, than their bodies. The firſt two ſentences onely give matter of exception. I ſay then, the company in one houſe, might be ſo great that one Lambe onely could not afford to every perſon one bit. <hi>Salomons</hi> dayly proviſion was; 1 <hi>King.</hi> 4.22. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 30. meaſures of fine flower, and 60. meaſures of meale, 10. fat Oxen, 20. Oxen out of the Paſtures, 100. ſheep beſides Harts, Roe-Buckes, Fallow-Deere, and fatted Fowle. Could one Lambe afford one morſell a peece, for a Paſchall Sacrifice to every one of this houſhold, and dayly eaters? a Wheate-cornes weight of the Lambe could not have beene ſufficient for every one, but ſome would have wanted. Againe we never reade, that if the family were over-great, and ſuper-numerous, they were commanded to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide their companies and goe to other houſes; but if they were too few, they went to the next houſe. So one Lambe was not killed in ſome houſe or houſes; but for all this, two or more Lambes might be eaten in one houſe, in another houſe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, God appointed rather of the two, that they ſhould have too much, rather than too little, and tooke order for the burning of the remainder; whence fairely reſulteth he intended every one ſhould have ſome, and a competencie, yet ſome might be left. If the Sacred Morſels had beene ſcant, and ſome had wanted to eate, it had beene a great ſinne, the un-eating ſoules ſhall be cut off, <hi>Num.</hi> 9.13. <hi>The man that is cleane, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keepe the Paſſeover, the ſame ſoule ſhall be cut off from Gods people.</hi> In other Sacrifices, the Primitive appointment was that ſome parts of them were to be burned, and others eaten; the Prieſt being to haue his ſhare, <hi>Levit.</hi> 7.30. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But in the Paſſeover all of it was to be eaten, if they could eate all, and the remainder was to be burned; not onely the bones but the fleſh alſo. <hi>Maymonides</hi> (on <hi>Corban Peſach, cap</hi> 9. <hi>ſect.</hi> 1.) ſaith, two companies might eate two Lambes, in one houſe; but they muſt not be mingled; nor looke one company upon, or to another. By the ſame reaſon, ſay I, in ſeverall roomes there may be ſeverall companies,, and ſeverall Lambes according to the numbers of the family; proportioning the Lambes to the fraternity, or the fraternity to the Lambes; from five, ſixe, or more, both companies, and Paſſeovers. Chriſt and his Colledge of Apoſtles are the Paſchall Lambe in an upper-chamber; yet the Maſter of the family, and ſome other with him, might eate their Paſſeover other-where, in the ſame houſe: <hi>In one houſe it muſt be eaten,</hi> therefore it might not be eaten with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doores, <hi>ſub Dio, in aprico,</hi> not in Bowers, not in Tents purpoſely erected, but in their ſtanding houſes. No eating without the houſe, figureth this propoſition; no Salvation is without the Church. <hi>Non habet Deum patrem, qui non habet eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am matrem.</hi> He hath not God for his father, that hath not the Church for his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I could wiſh thoſe factioniſts, to whom the very name of the Church is odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that they would remember this leſſon, God is not their Father, if the Church be not their mother: they that are cut off from the Church by excommunication, are in a moſt fearefull eſtate, and are excluded from this ſacred Supper. The beaſts, and beaſtly men which were not in the Arke, were all drowned. In (one) houſe it muſt be eaten; Schiſme, and ſeparations are herein forbidden. In one houſe or roome as ſome interpret it: the <hi>Chaldee</hi> interpreter hath it moſt ſignificantly, <hi>In one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany;</hi> as if there might be divers roomes, and divers Lambes, and divers ſocieties;
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:47497:84"/>but onely one Paſchall-Lambe, in one roome, and one company. More Lambes, in populous families, might be eaten in one houſe, upon no occaſion might one Lamb be eaten in two houſes. There was <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nus in unâ domo agnus,</hi> one Lambe in one houſe ſaith <hi>Adam Contzen</hi> the Jeſuite: not <hi>unicus,</hi> one onely ſay I; yes, ſaith he; and he proveth it by <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.3. and inferreth that the Lambe was provided, foure dayes before. What of that? the proviſion of the Lambe, foure dayes before, was none of the durable Rites; but ſerved them then, againſt the preſent exigent, the place in <hi>Exodus,</hi> doth not evince, that every houſe muſt have a Lambe, but rather the contrary. For if the houſhould be too little for the Lambe, <hi>let him and his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour next to his houſe take it, ver.</hi> 4. So that one of their houſes muſt be empty, and have no Lambe in it. Nor doe the words containe, that ſome populous full fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and ſupernumery, might not have more Lambes, as I ſayd before. <hi>It muſt be (eaten)</hi> it had beene a mocke if ſome had beene preſent and not eaten. It was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined for uſe, not for ſhew. At what age the young Jewes began to eate the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall-Lambe, cannot exactly be defined: this I hold, to be moſt certaine. They that were of ſufficient diſcretion, to judge of ſo holy Myſteries, and fitted to receive, thoſe did eate it; but becauſe ſome come to ripeneſſe, and underſtanding before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: there was no fixed time of their age appointed. I alſo conclude, upon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilitie, that the young children that uncleane perſons, that the over-oppreſſed with grievous paines or ſickeneſſe, being unable to receive, and eate it, I ſay, none of theſe were preſent in the roome or place where the Paſſeover was eaten. In o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther roomes of the ſame houſe, they might be; there is no likelihood that they were ſhut out of doores. The next durable Circumſtance was this. The people might kill the Lambe; the immolation of the Paſſeover was not appropriated to the Prieſthood.</p>

                        <p>THat the people might not preſume, themſelves to ſacrifice, but that they were to bring their offerings unto the Prieſts, and they to offer and ſlay them, is confeſſed by all; and apparent in many places, both of <hi>Exodus,</hi> and <hi>Leviticus, Heb.</hi> 7.27. The High Prieſt did offer up <hi>ſacrifice, firſt for his owne ſinnes, and then for the peoples: Heb.</hi> 10.11. <hi>Every Prieſt ſtandeth ministring, and offering many times the ſame ſacrifice.</hi> It was the ſinne of <hi>Corah,</hi> that being but a Levite, he would uſurpe the office of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſonnes. much leſſe might the people dare, to ſlay their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices. The Levites might not come nigh the veſſels of the Sanctuary, and the Altar, that neither they nor you alſo dye, <hi>Num.</hi> 18.3. <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sonnes ſhall keepe the Prieſts Office, <hi>for every thing of the Altar, ver.</hi> 7. Yet either Prieſt or Levite, or any Lay-man, the head of a family, might officiate the ſlaying of the Paſſe-over. As the former is true, for the generall; ſo for this their Jewiſh Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for the Paſſeover in eſpeciall; no <hi>Iſraelite (caeteris paribus)</hi> who had compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie of meanes, and company, and other requiſites, was excluded, but might ſlay it. Every maſter of the houſhold, either ſlayed, or appointed others to ſlay the Paſſeover, <hi>Iubente Lege,</hi> by the letter of the Law, ſaith <hi>Ioſephus (Antiq.</hi> 2.6.) <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne vulgus filiorum Iſrael,</hi> all the whole aſſembly of the Congregation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as before I cited out of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> againſt the Jewes. <hi>Philo (in vitâ Moſis) <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſo populo celebrante laetas epulas, quiſque ſe gerit pro Sacerdote;</hi> when the whole aſſembly doth celebrate the Paſſeover, every one doth execute the Prieſts Office: againe, (<hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de vitâ Moſis) Non (ut alias) plebeii homines victimas adducunt ad Altare, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctandas â Sacerdotibus, ſed Tota gens ſacrificat;</hi> the <hi>Laicks</hi> doe not (as at other times) bring their Sacrifices, to the Altar, to be ſlaine by the Prieſts, but the whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth offer ſacrifice. <hi>Idem, (in lib. de Decalogo) popularitèr ſinguli ſacrificant, non expectatis ſacerdotibus; ipſipermiſſu legis fungentes ſacerdotio, quotannis, per unum diem.</hi> The ſame <hi>Philo,</hi> in his booke of the <hi>Decalogue</hi> ſaith, every one doe offer Sacrifice not expecting their Prieſts; but they themſelves, by the permiſſion of the Law, doe

By which, or the like words, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Ioſephus,</hi> nor <hi>Philo,</hi> doe meane, that univerſally all, and every Iew killed the paſſeover. But every Maſter of a Family, ſufficiently compleate in number for the eating of the Paſchall-Lambe, he was the Prieſts in that buſineſſe, unleſſe ſickneſſe, or ſome other caſualty of moment, cauſed him to depute another to that office; <hi>Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Paſchalis non â Sacerdotibus, ſed â multitudine immolabatur;</hi> the Paſchall-Lambe was ſlaine, not by the Prieſts, but by the multitude, ſaith <hi>Kemnitius.</hi> He might have expreſſed the matter, handſomer: for, there is a double apparent untruth in his words, as they preſent themſelves, to the firſt apprehenſion. No doubt, ſome Prieſts killed ſome Paſchall Lambes, namely, ſuch as were to ſerve their owne houſes, and the Maſter of each houſe, was <hi>ſelectus è multitudine,</hi> Choſen out of the multitude; and repreſented the Prieſt, on the one ſide; and the multitude, under him, on the other ſide. Indeed the Scripture phraſe doth afford him ſome <hi>Patrocinie;</hi> for, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.6. Its ſaid, <hi>The whole aſſembly of the Congregation ſhall kill it;</hi> where, the whole aſſemly, &amp; Congregation, hath reference to the particular aſſemblies, in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry private houſe, where the Lambe was to be ſlaine; where, one man ſtood, <hi>Idaealiter,</hi> by way of repreſentation, for the reſt; for, it is moſt incredible, that all, &amp; every one, of the aſſembly of the Congregation, could actually ſlay the Lambe. Shall we thinke there were ten ſlayers to every Lambe? Ten or more, even as many, as were to be eaters of it? Was every Lambe, a <hi>Iulius Caeſar,</hi> ſtabbed by multitudes? no, no; one in each family, ſufficed for that buſineſſe. Now as wee have avoyded the one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame of ſuch as doe thinke, that every one indeede, of the whole Nation, did actually ſacrifice (though I will readily confeſſe, that every of that Nation might ſacrifice, and not one was excluded; but any one, who had a covenient houſe, and company under him, might then act the Prieſt) for himſelfe, and perhaps; any man deputed, might doe it for his Maſter, or, at his appointment. So, we muſt avoyd the other extreame of <hi>Maymonides,</hi> who avoucheth, that the Prieſts killed the Lambes, and flayed them; and the provider of the Lambe brought it dead to his houſe, and roſted it, and are it. But this is a groſſe errour of the Iewiſh Doctor. The Prieſts might kill for their own families, who will deny it? and they only might kill other Sacrifices (for that is our of queſtion) but he wanteth proofe to conclude, that the Prieſts onely did ſlay the Paſſeover, for all the people; and if ſome few Prieſts, at ſome extraordinary time, or occaſions, had perchance done ſo: yet the Prieſts did in trude, and uſurpe the more common right, and did ill, to monopolize, that office. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> (<hi>de miſsâ,</hi> 1.7.) <hi>Paſcha non offerebatur â ſolis ſacerdotibus, ſed â multis, non ſacerdotibus;</hi> many that were not Prieſts (I ſay, nor Levites neither) ſlew the Paſchall Lambe; and he giveth an excellent reaſon; <hi>Hoc ſacrificium inſtitutum fuit, antequàm familia Aaron determinabatur ad ſacerdotum; &amp; ideò quantùm ad hoc ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificium, manſit antiquum privilegium, ut omnes patres familiâs ſacerdotio fungerentur;</hi> Before the <hi>Aronicall</hi> Prieſthood was appointed, and choſen, after the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> paſſeover, and before the Prieſthood of <hi>Aaron,</hi> the chiefe of the family, the firſt-borne, the fathers of the houſholds had the right, and exerciſe of the Prieſthood annexed unto the priviledges of their <hi>Primogeniture;</hi> which ancient Cuſtome they obſerved in this poynt, not onely at the firſt Paſſeover, but ever after; even when the Prieſthood was ſetled on <hi>Aaron,</hi> and his ſonnes, or families, unleſſe they were defiled, as 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 30.17. or elſe, ſome other great occaſion interceded.</p>

Yea, but it is ſaid, 1 <hi>Eſdr as</hi> 7.12. <hi>The Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites offered the Paſſeover, for all them of the Captivity, and for their brethren the Prieſts, and for themſelves?</hi> I anſwer, as it is in the precedent <hi>verſes.</hi> They that were of the Captivity, were not all ſanctified together: but the <hi>Levites</hi> were all ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied together. Want of ſanctification might make them unfit, who otherwiſe had right enough to have diſcharged the duty. The ſecond Objection, <hi>Ezra.</hi> 6.20. <hi>The Prieſts, and the Levites were purified together; all of them were pure, and killed the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:47497:85"/>for all the children of the Captivity, and for their brethren the Prieſts, and for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?</hi> I anſwer, the Prieſts, and Levites extraordinary ſanctification in the pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the multitude, reached them out an handle, on juſt opportunity to doe that, which others might have done, if they had beene truely ſanctified. This anſwer is confirmed, 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 30.17. <hi>Many in the Congregation were not ſanctified; therfore the Levites had the charge of killing of the Paſſeover, for every one that was not cleane; and the uncleane did eate it, but not kill it.</hi> And God heard the voyce of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> praying; <hi>the good Lord pardon every one, that prepareth his heart, to ſeeke God, though he be not cleanſed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the purification of the Sanctuary, ver.</hi> 18. and 19. Obſerve, I pray you, the force of the <hi>illative,</hi> Therefore, <hi>Therefore the Prieſts had the charge of killing the Paſſeover.</hi> Why? firſt, becauſe many in the Congregation were not ſanctified. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, They killed the Paſſeover for every one, who was not there; it is not ſaid the Levites or Prieſts killed the Paſſeover, for all, and every one of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation (the cleane might ſacrifice for themſelves, and their families) but for every one; that was not cleane, did the Prieſts and Levites kill the Paſſeover. Laſtly, ſome interprete the immolation by the Prieſts, and Levites onely, of the <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chalia ſacrificia,</hi> the Paſchall Sacrifices (ſo <hi>Barradius</hi> termeth them) and not of the great paſſeover: <hi>Sacrificium Paſcha,</hi> the ſacrifice of the paſſeover; but becauſe, there may ſeeme little difference, in this diſtinction: I rather diverſifie it thus. They ſlew, and flayed the ſacrifices of the <hi>Chagigah:</hi> not of the Sacramentall <hi>Paſcha;</hi> of the Herd, not of the flocke: or, if they did ſacrifice any of the flocke, Lambs Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or Rammes, theſe were not for the firſt diſh of the firſt Courſe, the firſt night of the Paſchall ſolemnity (which was to be an unſpotted Male; under a yeare old, &amp;c.) but for the other ſecond diſhes of the ſecond courſe; or, for other dayes, of their great <hi>Septemdiale Feſtum,</hi> Feſtivity of ſeven dayes.</p>

I, for my part thinke, that, as the <hi>Primo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitus,</hi> or Firſt-borne did willingly, and moſt ordinarily performe the duty, in his owne perſon: So, there were divers diſpenſable occaſions, which might permit him, to conſigne over that office, of preparing the paſſeover, for ſome times, to another, in his place, and, as his ſubſtitute, with vicariall power. <hi>Barradius</hi> (more peremptory than <hi>Belarmin</hi>) ſaith, Chriſt himſelfe ſlew the paſſeover. Where is his proofe? That Chriſt himſelfe [might] have ſlaine the paſſeover, I deny not: hee had a double right unto it; firſt, as <hi>Paterfamilias,</hi> or Maſter of the Family: ſecondly, as he was a Prieſt ſpiritually, of the order of <hi>Melchizedek,</hi> and had the fountaine of all authority, and Prieſthood in him, as he was the eternall Prieſt; but, <hi>â poſſe ad eſſe non valet conſequentia;</hi> from what he (might) have done, to what he actually did doe, is no good conſequence; or, he might have done it; <hi>Ergo,</hi> he did doe it, is no good Argument: and the queſtion is not, <hi>de jure,</hi> of the right; but, <hi>de facto,</hi> of the deede. This perhaps might be one reaſon, why he deſigned others to ſlay the paſſeover; leſt, if he had ſlaine it himſelfe; ſome miſ-judging people might have beene deceived, and perhaps thought him to be a Prieſt lineally deſcended from <hi>Levi,</hi> or <hi>Aaron</hi> (who were not excluded from ſlaying the paſſeover, in their owne houſes) but Chriſts pedigree is not counted from <hi>Levi,</hi> or his ſonnes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.6. nor is he to be called Prieſt, after the order of <hi>Aaron, ver.</hi> 11. but appertaineth to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the Altar, <hi>ver.</hi> 13.

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, our Saviour hearkened to their requeſt, as there it followeth. Thirdly, Chriſt made an exempt of his Diſciples, retaining ſome with himſelfe, and he ſent others, to make ready the paſſeover. Fourthly, thoſe two, whom he ſent, were none of the meaneſt, but rather the chiefeſt of his Apoſtles, S. <hi>Peter.</hi> and S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> as it is, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.8. Fiftly, in the ſacrificing of the paſſeover, you may obſerve theſe diſtinct grada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; in termes unconfuſed and proprietie of Language. 1. The preparing of the paſſeover may imply, the chooſing of a fit legall Lambe. 2. Then ſucceeding the ſlaying of it. 3. There was the making of it ready, that is, flaying, paunching, waſhing, dreſſing, and roaſting it. 4. Laſtly, followed eating of it. Sixtly, when the Diſciples had made ready the Paſſeover, it is likely that S. <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp; S. <hi>John</hi> went out to meete him; for he cometh in the Evening with the 12. <hi>Marke</hi> 14.17. and the Preparers went from him forth before, as it is, <hi>verſ.</hi> 16.7. Moſt certaine it is, Chriſt appointed his Diſciples to prepare, and make ready the Paſſeover, (in which is neceſſarily included the immolation) and himſelfe came not, till the Evening, that is, till the exact houre; when all things were made ready; and when it was to be eaten.</p>

He is diſtempered, who thinketh that God preſcribed diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering food; meate parched like coales, rather then well-ordered, well-cooked meate, in ſo extraordinary a ſacrifice, and Sacrament. In the great Paſſeover of the good <hi>Iaſiah,</hi> other Sacrifices indeed were boyled in ſeverall inſtruments: but the Paſſeover, the proper Paſſeover was roſted, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 35.13. The vertue in ſod meate is extracted, in roſt meate contracted. Sod meate ſpends its ſtrength in the pottage, or ſome part of it, in bettering the broth, more than the roſt doth. (I have heard of ſome, who have ſpoyled their meate, to make good pottage,) If any one aske, what was the ſubſtance of this ſhadow? and why water was forbid, and fire permitted? I am loath to give this reaſon; that the great inundation by waters was paſſed, but the fire of conflagration was pointed at; or, that <hi>Moſes</hi> his taking out of the water was here remembred, as paſt; and the fiery Pillar, fiery Serpents, and fiery tryall of them, was prefigured; or, that Chriſt did baptize with the holy Ghoſt, and with fire, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.11. or, <hi>that the cloven tongues, as of fire, Act.</hi> 2.3. were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly reſembled.

No marvaile, he thirſted, and ſayd, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> At his agony in the garden, Chriſt was ſo inwardly fired, and roſted, as <hi>Iuſtinus</hi> phrazeth it, that he ſweate great drops of blood: nor were thoſe <hi>grumi ſanguinis, ſine guttis aquae,</hi> thoſe drops of blood, without drops of water, in all likelihood; ſo when he was as on the ſpit of the Croſſe, and when they digged his hands, and his feete, did not both water, and blood guſh forth? I am ſure, when his ſide was pierced, there flowed out, both blood, and water, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19.34.</p>

In this point, two things are obſervable from the Jewiſh profeſſour. Firſt, that every man of ability came into the Temple; the great firſt day of the Feaſt; and there, and then, was to make his offering, a burnt-offering, either of fowle, or beaſt; yet if ſickeneſſe hindred him by the way; ſo that of neceſſitie, he came tardy at the beginning, yet his firſt day of appearing in the Temple, (what day ſoever it were) was to him, the day of his offering; and as the firſt day of the feaſt, to others. Secondly, no man was bound to bring his offertory, on the other dayes of the feaſt, though he appeared often in the Court, and holy Convocation, yet if any man would, it was accepted; and the more Religious the people were, the more they gave, proportionable to their worth: remember the royall gifts of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> for offering day by day, during their great Paſſeovers, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 30.24. and of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 35.7. and the moſt munificent offerings of <hi>Joſiahs</hi> Princes, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>Tea, to the people Hezekiah ſayd; Come neare, and bring Sacrifices, and thankeſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings; into the houſe of the Lord; and the Congregation brought in ſacrifices, and thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings; and as many as were of a free heart, burnt offerings,</hi> 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 29.31. <hi>And the offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings were more, than the Prieſts could kill, ver.</hi> 34. It is moſt remarkeable, what even the moſt learned Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> confeſſeth, and what is a knowne truth; that one way, or other, the Iewes did pay, by Gods appointment, the fift part of their whole e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:47497:87"/>unto the Lord, and his Prieſts, annually. Let the Sacrilegious tithe-robbers, ſeriouſly weigh that point: we have too many ſo devout forſooth, that they give to God their eares; yet ſo prophane and covetous, that they will afford God no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but their eares. A ſingle ſcute, or farthing, they will not offer, (how rich ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be) unleſſe the Law compell them; unleſſe their Prieſts be at their beckes; dues, duties, or Revenewes, they cannot abide to neare of; yet God hath done more for us Chriſtians than he did for the Iewes; and therefore out returne unto the Lord ought to exceede theirs. It was a well-weighed collection of <hi>Chryſoſtom's,</hi> that a good Chriſtian, when he conſidereth what the Iewes pay'd to their Prieſts, and Levites, will thinke more is due from him: even <hi>Horace</hi> condemned himſelfe, for having beene, <hi>Parcus deorum cultor, &amp; infrequent,</hi> a ſpare, and ſeldome wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipper of God: <hi>David</hi> would not offer to the Lord, but, that which coſt him enough for it; nor would the Father of the faithfull, conſecrate his Church-yard, or <hi>Abrahemium,</hi> for a burying place, till he had payd for it. But, we have a late ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Religion-framers, who; as I ſayd before, give nothing willingly unto God, but their eares, which coſt them nothing; and have found (as they thinke) the cheapeſt way to heaven, that ever was thought of by any unleſſe Atheiſts; by keeping all to themſelves; as if no Recognition, by goods, were due to God, for his Creation, Univerſall Dominion, generall preſervation, and particular bleſſings upon men. The Iewes gave God of his owne, as much as they were able, let Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians looke to it; and that they may the better looke to it; (at leaſt, for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their tyth's) let them conſider, what <hi>Auguſtine</hi> writeth (<hi>Serm.</hi> 219. <hi>de Tempore</hi>) let us give thankes to God therefore, becauſe he gave us good Corne; and let us thinke of offering, or rather reſtoring backe the tithes to God; he who payeth no tithes, invadeth anothers goods. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Hierome</hi> (on the third of <hi>Malachi</hi>) what I ſayd of tithes, which were wont of old, to be payd by the people, to the Prieſts, and Levites; is commanded alſo to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of (our) Church; <hi>viz.</hi> not onely, to pay tithes; but to ſell all, and follow Chriſt; All in affection, and habite; not alwayes all actually; yet muſt the taught man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate unto him, that teacheth in all good things.

But, be not deceived, <hi>God is not mocked, Gal.</hi> 6.6. if thou payeſt not God, God will pay thee; as wee have opportunity, we muſt doe good to all men, eſpecially to them, who are of the houſhold of faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.10.

(as it muſt, or elſe in no caſe ſhall we enter into the kingdome of Heaven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.20.) if (they) dared not to taſte of their fruits before the Tenths were ſeparated for the Levites: and we doe no ſuch things, but ſo abuſe the fruites of the earth, that nor Prieſt, nor Levite, nor Altar partake of it: It is convenient, and profitable, that firſt-fruites ſhould be payd, to the Prieſts of the Goſpell; for the Lord hath ſo ordeined, that they who Preach the Goſpell, ſhould live of the Goſpell: Contrarily, it is uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, unworthy, and impious; that he, who worſhippeth God, and goeth into his Church, and knoweth that the Prieſts, and Miniſters waite at the Altar; doth not give the firſt-fruites to the Prieſts, of thoſe fruites of the ground, which God giveth by his ſun, and his raine; I thinke ſuch a ſoule hath no memory or mind of God; nor thinketh nor beleeveth; that God gave thoſe fruits, which he ſo hideth, as ſtrange from God: For, if he beleived them, to be given of God; he would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo know, to honour God, by rewarding his Prieſts: what Chriſt would have done by the Phariſes; more, and more abundantly, would he have his Diſciples to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme; and very earneſt he is, for the firſt f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>THe marrow might not be taken forth; perhaps to intimate, that man may not be too-buſie, with Gods ſecret counſells, with pearles wrapt up, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed in his owne breaſt: for, as in the breaking of the bones, ſome marrow is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed; ſo, in the determining of hidden things, Gods wiſedome is too-much intrenched upon, undervalved, and by humane reaſon, or conjecture, broken in pieces: wherefore, God will have ſome, and the daintieſt, and chiefeſt things, as the marrow in the bone, reſerved from mans curioſitie, which man muſt not ſeeke after: other hard matters there are, that he may exerciſe his wit upon, and picke upon; ſee <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.29. though it had beene a young Lambe, whoſe bones are little, and no harder, than ſome ſinewes; yet they muſt forbeare, from the eating of them; for they were bones, though tender. In the ſlaying of the paſſover, they were to take heede of breaking a bone; at the taking out of the entralls, at the cutting out of the heart, liver, and lungs (for they were to be waſhed, and cleanſed) they were to take heede, leſt they brake a bone; they were ſo to ſpit it, and faſten it on the Spit, and take it from the Spit, that no bone of it was to be broken: Laſtly, they were neither ſo to eate of the fleſh, nor ſo to carry and to burne the remainder, that any bone at all was to be broken: In a myſtery, this might ſignifie, that not one Article of our beliefe; not one mayne poynt, which upholdeth Chriſtianity (as the bones do the body) may be broken; but muſt be preſerved intire; yea, it might imply,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:47497:91"/>that no one Commandement of God is to be broken, <hi>I am.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall keepe the whole Law, and yet offend in one poynt</hi> (if he breake but one bone) <hi>he is guilty of all:</hi> how can thoſe words be reconciled? <hi>To keepe the whole Law, and yet to offend in one poynt?</hi> I anſwer, to keepe the whole Law, except one poynt onely. In like ſort, our bleſſed Saviour ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.31. <hi>All manner of ſinne and blaſphemy ſhall be forgiven men; but the blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt ſhall not be forgiven;</hi> you may ſay, Is not the blaſphemy againſt the holy Ghoſt, a ſinne, and blaſphemy? I anſwer, it is, but the native proper ſenſe of the words, implyeth onely this; that all blaſphemy ſhall be forgiven, except the blaſphemy againſt the holy Ghoſt. Laſtly, the not breaking of the bone might typifie; that, <hi>till heaven and earth paſſe, one jot, or one title ſhall in no wiſe paſſe from the Law</hi> (no, not from the law of the Paſſeover) <hi>till all be fulfilled, Matth.</hi> 5.18. The <hi>Iewes</hi> doe conſtantly avouch, that the Almighty hath more care of every word, ſyllable, and letters of the old Teſtament, than hee hath of the ſtarres in heaven: and the <hi>Iewes</hi> themſelves have beene ſo exceſſively, even to a prodigie, carefull and diligent, that they have reckned, how many times every ſeverall letter in their Alphabet, is to be found in all the old Teſtament. Againe, I will not ſay, but that, by the not breaking off a bone, may be meant, either a hard place of Scripture, is not too-much to be forced, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16. or elſe, that no words of Chriſt were ſuperfluous, or vaine; no promiſe of his ſhould be broken, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine firme, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.35. <hi>Heaven and earth ſhall paſſe away, but my words ſhall not paſſe away.</hi>

                        <p>NOw though it be generally confeſſed; the eating of unleavened bread ſeven dayes, was one of the laſting Ceremonies; yet ſome queſtion; whether this was commanded, to begin at the firſt <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Paſſeover? That much feaſting was then commanded, I cannot thinke; that they went out onely with unleavened bread, is apparent; that they are onely unleavened bread, till Manna did fall, <hi>Ioſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> ſaith: But they are not unleavened bread, with a religious intent, but for want of other bread, ſaith D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Willet:</hi> if he ſpeake of the laſt 23. dayes; I confeſſe they had no religious reſpect, in the eating of unleavened bread: for they had no precept to eate unleavened beyond 7. dayes, in any ſacred relation: yet conſider, that the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of 7. dayes eating unleavened bread, was enjoyned, before they went out of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> and ſo they undoubtedly obſerved them. Oh, but ſaith Dr. <hi>Willet,</hi> they went out in haſte? I anſwere, haſte and Religion may ſtand together; yea, they had beene irreligious, in that point, if they had not haſted; they had haſte, and were in all haſte, till the Armies of <hi>Aegypt</hi> were drowned; Now this being 7. dayes, from the eating of the Paſchall-Lambe; the inhibition of leavened bread conduced more, to haſten their haſte: For unleavened bread, or manchets, or cakes are ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner made, than any flower or bread can be leavened; make <hi>ready quickly three meaſures of fine meale</hi> ſaith <hi>Abraham,</hi> to <hi>Sarah, Gen.</hi> 18.6.

Laſtly, the Divine Scriptures are to be underſtood li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally, as they offer themſelves, in their firſt ſenſe to the hearer, or reader, (if there follow no inconvenience, or abſurditie) therefore in the commandement to eate unleavened bread 7. dayes, is included a ſacred duty; and an holy obſervation might be performed, though they had no other bread to eate, though they were in

Certainely, great reaſon there was, that nothing ſhould be left untill the morning; for the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> might have profaned it; dogges might have torne it; and if there were any part left, ſome perhaps might have worſhipped it. As it was to be roſted whole, ſo they might eate it wholy, if they could conveniently without gluttony, exceſſe, or any other intemperancie; and if the number of Communicants had beene great, and the Lambe but little, and <hi>adaequate</hi> for them. Voluntary offerings might be eaten, on the firſt day, and if any remained, it might bee eaten, on the ſecond day; but on the third day; the remainder of the fleſh was to bee burnt with fire, <hi>Levit.</hi> 7.16. <hi>&amp;c.

And yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God never liked intemperance, rather than they ſhould play the gluttons, and cramme their guts too full; he commanded them to burne that, which was left; and this was an unchangeable, cloſing, and parting ceremony.</p>

But might not one Eagle fly ſwifter than another? Might not one finde more, and better prey, and be longer a feeding on it than another? For, they were not able to fly over halfe the world, without bayting; and one Eagle might wander, from the right way, or line, and fetch compaſſes, more than another; and could not he, who is ſaid to let goe the Eagles, one from the Eaſt; another from the Weſt, have eaſier meaſured it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, than truſt two unreaſonable creatures with that diſcovery? You, ſay the <hi>Scythians,</hi> to <hi>Alexander,</hi> in <hi>Curtius</hi> (<hi>lib.</hi> 7 <hi>pap.</hi> 212.) would, if you could, hold the Eaſt in one hand, and the Weſt in another: did you ſo, <hi>Iupiter,</hi> by the two Eagles? And, did you let them fly, both at the ſame time? Did they fly both night, and day, and make their way, through darkeneſſe? If the Eaſterne Eagle were caſt off, at their Sun-riſing; our Weſterne Eagle was then caſt off, about our midnight; oh wiſe Eagles, and fooliſh <hi>Iupiter!</hi> oh mad people, to beleeve in ſuch lyes, in ſuch gods!

In which waſhings and bathings of their bodies: the tradition of the Elders was ſo ſtrict, that the bathing was of none effect; if any part or the leaſt particle of the body, but ſo much as the top of his little finger, were not waſhed: yea, he muſt waſh not onely his head, but all his hayre, and every locke of his head, which the tradition of the Elders eſteemed as his body: <hi>Maymonides</hi> expoundeth <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law thus: In every place where is mention made of bathing the fleſh, and waſhing the garments of the uncleane; you muſt underſtand it of laving the whole body in water: when they waſhed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their cloathes, the Law was not ſatisfied, unleſſe the water did ſinke through their cloathes, to wet their whole bodies: or if any part were kept by the cloathes, from being waſhed. So, the cloathes were rather looſe, then girt, or ſo girded, that the water, for all that had free paſſage.</p>

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:47497:106"/>that Ceremonie towards Chriſt: At their more ſolemne feaſts; the cuſtome of the wealthier ſort, may be granted to be ſuch; not at their dayly repaſts; and to gueſts of prime note, of upper-moſt roomes, at feaſts, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.6. of the chiefeſt ſeates, not to the men <hi>imi ſubjellii,</hi> as the Paraſite, in <hi>Plautus,</hi> phraſeth it.</item>
                              <item>2. Chriſt found fault with his omiſſion accidentally; and as he reproved him not, at the firſt ſitting to meale, ſo we may thinke, he would have wholly paſſed by that point, of the Phariſees incivility, if the Religious act of that devout woman had not mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred a faire occaſion of fault finding.</item>
                              <item>3. Our Saviour was to be reputed, above any ordinary gueſt; and his entertainement to be above any feaſting; for he never ate with any, but he fed their ſoules, more with grace and goodneſſe: then they fed him, or his Apoſtles with bodily food: therefore juſtly was the Phariſee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooved, becauſe on ſo momentuall occaſions, and times, and perſons, fit for the beſt entertainement; both for the matter, and the manner of their well-come, both Reall, and Complementall; he neglected that Ceremonie, of anoynting our Lord.</item>
                              <item>4. The penitent womans act had not beene ſo glorious, if the faſhion had beene ordinary or dayly, at every meale: To the ſecond inſtance of <hi>Pererius,</hi> I ſay; the Lord commandeth the Faſter to anoynt his head) as if he were very merry, chearefull, or going to a feaſt indeed) as if he feaſted; not as if he dined onely, as <hi>Pererius</hi> hath it: for they had many dinners, and many ſuppers, in which they uſed none anoyntings; and where joy and mirth were not alwayes ſeene attendant, at the Table, nor to be diſcerned by their lookes, as Chriſt would have it ſeene in him who faſted before God; and ſeemed not to faſt before men: to the third in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, I ſay, the fact of <hi>Mary</hi> powring oyntment on the head of Chriſt, was rather heroically devout and divine, than a matter of faſhion; ſhe durſt have done that holy deede, if anoynting had never beene uſed, in feaſtings; for, her end was hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly; <hi>Againſt the day of my burying hath ſhe kept this ſaith Chriſt, Ioh.</hi> 12.7. and I doubt not but ſhe had ſupernall inſpirations, directing her to doe ſo; if we ſhall argue from a ſingular fact, to a generall uſance, (as <hi>Pererius</hi> doth) then one might as well conclude, that waſhing ones feere with teares, and wiping them with the haires of a womans head, without ceaſing, was the cuſtome of thoſe times, becauſe the himbled penitent did ſo, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.44.</item>

So farre <hi>Pererius:</hi> I anſwere, what hee ſaith beſides; that Chriſt perſwaded the gueſts, who choſe out the chiefeſt roomes, not to ſit downe, in the higheſt roomes, <hi>Luke.</hi> 14.7.8. But to ſit downe in the loweſt roome, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. ſeemeth to proove that Chriſt himſelfe did not affect
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:47497:117"/>the higheſt roomes (and perchance poſſeſſed it not) for he would not goe againſt his owne advizoes, nor practiſe that which he faulted in the Phariſees. Indeede, it is a well-weighed argument of <hi>Pererius,</hi> that the reſting of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> upon the breaſt of our Saviour, both ſhew that our bleſſed Saviour Ieſus Chriſt did lye above S. <hi>Iohn:</hi> But that <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> could not powre the Oyntment on his head, if Chriſt had ſate in the middle part of the bed; I ſee no reaſon to perſwade it: Sure I am, one ſinner ſtood at his feete behinde him; and began to waſh his feete with teares; and did wipe them with the haires of her head, and kiſſed his feete, and anoynted them, with the oyntment, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.38. And it is as ſure, that a woman, having an Alabaſter boxe of very precious Oyntment, powred it on his head, as he ſate at meate, <hi>Math.</hi> 26.7. and it was her intention to anoynt his body, <hi>Mark</hi> 14.8. and it is moſt likely ſhe did ſo; for ſhe came aforehand to anoynt his body to the buriall: but at their burialls, they were anoynted all over; and ſhe <hi>anoynted the Lord with Oyntment, Iob.</hi> 11.2. Nor ſee I any thing to the contrary, but whereſoever any one lay in any bed, or any place of any bed, their heads, bodies, and feete, might be anoynted by them, who ſtood behinde them, if they would bee at the coſt and labour, and if the diſcumbent would permit it, the beds were not ſo broad, but they might reach over them: that ſome place was higher and ſome lower, on thoſe beds, or, that ſome were chiefe, ſome meane, is confeſſed. They choſe out the chiefe roomes, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.7, there was a loweſt roome, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. and an higher, above the loweſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. and an higheſt roome, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. which was above the higher, and the comparative degree might be manifold in its latitude. That the chiefeſt place was due to Chriſt, in very many regards, whereſoever Chriſt ſupped, none will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that the prime place was offered unto him (for the moſt part) if not alwayes, I verily beleeve: But ſome aſſume it as a truth, that the middle place was the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in dignity: <hi>Cicero</hi> (<hi>lib.</hi> 9. <hi>Epiſt. ad Familiares</hi> in the laſt Epiſtle) telleth of a merry ſupper, that he was at, in <hi>Volumnius Eutrapelus</hi> his houſe, that <hi>Atticus</hi> lay above <hi>Cicero,</hi> and <hi>Verrius</hi> below him; yet <hi>Cicero</hi> was in dignity above <hi>Atticus:</hi> and in the luxurious Supper of <hi>Metellus, pontificis maximi,</hi> the Arch-biſhop ſo called by <hi>Macrobius</hi> (<hi>Saturnal.</hi> 3.13.) though the <hi>Triclinia lectis eburneis ſtrata fuerant;</hi> the Parlours were adorned with beds of Ivorie, and both the Antipaſt and ſupper are ſet downe, with almoſt incredible particulars; yet which is the higheſt place, or chiefeſt roome, is not deſcribed: Nine were on two beds, it is likely, foure on the one; <hi>Quintus Catulus, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, D.

The ſawce of the Paſchall-Lambe, was to be of divers ſorts of herbes; who ever ſayd, they were ſerved in with the Lambe, in the ſame diſh?

                           </gap>, as he that ſerveth: I anſwere, this rather proveth, that ſome did ſerve indeede, to whom Chriſt did liken himſelfe; that Chriſt did not ſerve (as others) but was as one, that ſerveth; <hi>Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctura miniſtrantium eſt;</hi> the being girded about, is a ſigne of ſervice, attendance, and adminiſtring; whilſt Chriſt was bound, and buſie with water and the baſon, and the towell, he might properly be ſayd, through his owne voluntary condeſcent, to ſerve and adminiſter; and ſo Kings and Queenes may be ſayd, to ſerve, when they deſcend to waſh the feete of the poore. Sixthly, S. <hi>Peters,</hi> and S. <hi>Johns</hi> praepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for the Paſſeover, may ſeeme to be of little waight, if all things, and every thing neceſſary was not throughly provided, but they muſt have others to attend: I anſwere, no preparation was ſo exquiſite, that waiters were unneceſſary; who ſhould fill out freſh wine? who remove the diſhes? who ſerve them in? who was to take them away? who to ſave or gather up the fragments? Seventhly, if any one beſides the Apoſtles, had beene there; we may thinke, the moſt bleſſed Virgin was there, but ſhe was not to be an attendant? I anſwere out of queſtion. Chriſts moſt holy Mother had not attended if ſhe had beene there; though ſhe would not grudge to waite on him; but his greateſt humility would never have permitted her, to ſerve him; yet other attendants might be, and were in likelihood, though ſhee were abſent. Eighthly, it is not likely, Chriſt would have waſhed his Apoſtles feete, eſpecially the feete of <hi>Iudas,</hi> if other attendants had beene there? I anſwere if in the preſence of others he did waſh them all; it was an evident ſigne of his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter humility, and then more might take good example, contrarily, for the Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. 1.

I anſwere, indeede they were diſtinct, in dignity and order; and the Apoſtles were a choyce ſort, ſelected out of the Diſciples and <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> were exempt in great matters, out of the reſt of the Apoſtles.</p>

Even the Devills were ſubject unto them, through Chriſts Name; and Chriſt ſayd unto them, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. <hi>Their names were written in heaven,</hi> and bids them rejoyce therefore. Are they reprobates, whoſe Names are written in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? And they had ſmall cauſe to rejoyce, if they were to be damned. True it is that many Diſciples of his went backe, yet it cannot be evinced, that any of the 70. were among the number of thoſe backeſliding Diſciples. I am ſure, beſides the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and beſides the 70; there were another ſort of people; who ſought him and followed him, for to ſatisfie their hungry guts. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.27. and in a large ſenſe, may be called Diſciples; and ſome perhaps followed him, for Novelty-ſake; ſome for curioſitie; others to ſpie bis wayes; others, to queſtion him, on the ſuddaine, and to entrap him;

                        <p>TO the firſt point; Becauſe enemies to Chriſt and his Religion; and Epicurean Libertines who make their belly their god, and live to eate; and eate to drinke: and indeed whoſe <hi>Bibere</hi> is (more then in pronunciation) <hi>Vivere:</hi> I ſay, becauſe they are likely to ſay, concerning our bleſſed Saviour; Is this that
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:47497:134"/>immaculate Lambe of God, void both of Originall and Actuall ſinne? Is this Hee whom yee beleeve to have faſted fortie dayes and fortie nights? and yet cannot one Supper content him? No nor the ſecond Supper, but was at three Suppers in one night? <hi>Fabius Gurges</hi> grew not to that height of ingurgitation: No <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,</hi> no <hi>Roman,</hi> no Effeminate Aſiatique in one night ate of three Suppers: Nor the Rich man, though he fared deliciouſly every day.

                        <p>I Anſwer, The firſt Supper was onely a Sacrament of the Old Teſtament, and Type of the New Teſtament; whereof they ate but ſparingly. For ſacred morſels were never intended to be fill-bellies.</p>
                        <p>At the ſecond Supper, he might eate a little. We read not expreſſely that hee ate much; diſcourſe, and the workes of mercie, humbleneſſe, good advice, and the cleere manifeſtation of the Traitor was the meate he then principally ate, for ought that can be diſcerned, or is revealed <hi>in terminis.</hi> But collectively and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentially thus. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11, 25. <hi>He tooke the Cup. Beza</hi> indeed hath it, <hi>poſtquam coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nati ſunt:</hi> after they had ſupped: and the <hi>Arabick, poſtquam ſumpſiſſent coenam ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am:</hi> after they had received their Supper; Chriſt and his Apoſtles together: but <hi>Tremellius</hi> rendreth it from the <hi>Syriac,</hi> viz. <hi>postquam coenaſſet</hi> in the ſingular: <hi>When Hee had ſupped.</hi> Therefore he did eat and ſup, and was not onely a beholder. <hi>Hee that eateth bread with me hath lift up his heele against me. Iohn</hi> 13.18. which words were ſpoken of Chriſt and <hi>Iudas,</hi> and are applyed to them. Therefore in proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilite, then he did eate, and ate with <hi>Iudas</hi> himſelfe: But this was at the ſecond Supper. For one Supper was ended. <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.2. (and that was the Paſchall) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> began his large diſcourſe in the ſame Chapter.</p>
                        <p>The third Supper being the moſt bleſſed Sacrament of the New Teſtament, had onely a little bread, and a little wine (which they did rather taſte of, then take in great quantitie) and doth wipe off the aſperſion of Gluttony, or Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or of any kinde of Intemperancie in meate and drinke. Thus againe, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was any found fault withall, who ate but little of the Paſchall Lambe. And leſt any ſhould force himſelfe to eate too much, the remainders (how great in quantitie ſoever they were) were commanded to be burnt. Never were a whole companie or family commanded to eate all, and every part of the Paſchall Lambe; ſo that nothing was to be left. A minde ſpiritually elevated, at holy feaſts, little eſteemeth muchneſſe of eating and drinking.</p>
                        <p>Sure it is, that what Chriſt with deſire deſired to eate, <hi>viz.</hi> the Paſſeover; he did eate it; he was not fruſtrated in his deſires; and the proſperous meanes led him on fairely, to the end of his intentions. The Paſſeover was prepared for Chriſt. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.17. <hi>Where wilt Thou that we prepare for Thee to cate the Paſſeover?</hi> Mark 14.12. <hi>Where wilt Thou, that we go, and prepare, that Thou maieſt eate the Paſſeover? Thou</hi> principally. For <hi>Thee,</hi> emphatically. Therefore we muſt ſay, He did eate part. Beſides, He ſaid, <hi>I will not any more eate thereof. Luke</hi> 22.16. Therefore He did then eate of it, or elſe the ſpeech were improper. <hi>When Hee dipped in the diſh. Mat.</hi> 26.23. He dipped with intent to take up ſomething, and to eate of it.</p>
                        <p>That He ate much of the Paſchall Lambe, and ſower Hearbs, I wholly denie. And cleerely, there are more paſſages, to prove the Apoſtles eating at the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, then our Saviours: As they ſate and did eate <hi>Mark</hi> 14.18. (Ieſus fell to diſcourſe) as they did eate, He ſaid, <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erily, &amp;c. Mat.</hi> 26.21. In both theſe places, the words are ſpoken excluſively, concerning Chriſt. As if it had beene ſaid, He was none of them, that at that inſtant did eate. Whilſt they did eate, Chriſt did not. At thoſe ſpeeches He ate not.</p>
                        <p>In concluſion; Of the Paſchall Supper, Hee neither ate much, nor nothing;
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:47497:135"/>His end approaching, and He knowing the wonderfull paines He was to endure, He had little ſtomack to eate much. Yet duty and Religion both ſharpened his deſire to eate ſome, and his actuall-orall-manducation followed.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the ſecond Supper, it cannot be proved, that He did partake much of it; nor is there any great likelihood for it. For, <hi>He was tronbled in Spirit. Iohn</hi> 13.21. And ſuch have no great appetite to their victuals. Indeed Hee tooke a ſop, and dipped it; and gave it to <hi>Iudas. Iohn</hi> 13.26. But there is <hi>altum ſilenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> not a word concerning his owne free eating of any thing largely, in this ſecond Supper. Therefore no imputation of intemperancie can faſten hold on him.</p>
                        <p>So in the third Supper, the Scripture mentioneth not, either that he did, or did not eate. And many thinke Hee gave it, and adminiſtred it; but are not of it himſelfe; though I opine, He did taſte of both kindes. But of this hereafter.</p>
                        <p>This ſufficeth to cleare our bleſſed Saviour from any ſhadow of exceſſe at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or at all of theſe three Suppers in one night. The phraſe of three Suppers in one night, ſounding in ſome mens eares very prophanely; but being in truth farre more holy, then onely one ordinary Supper of civill men.</p>

                        <p>TO the other parts of the Epicureans exception, who would willingly ſhelter themſelves under our Saviours example, that they might bee intemperate lawfully: I anſwer; that when I have produced what I can, to ſhew our bleſſed Saviours moſt temperate behaviour; I doubt not but any different man will ſay, that Chriſt went beyond all that ever were renowned in Heathen ſtory, for their moderation in meats and drinks.</p>

If a man would reaſon againſt God, according as the Jewes doe, againſt both him and Chriſt: One might ſay; It had beene a great wonder indeed, if <hi>Adams</hi> wife had beene but three or foure yeares of age, and had brought him forth children. But we may more truly ſay concerning both <hi>Eve,</hi> and the bleſſed mother of our Lord, Gods will was his law: what he decreed, was performed: what was performed, was beſt of all; what God ſpake before by his holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, muſt be accompliſhed, however the folly of man, would ſeeme to project better courſes.</p>
                        <p>Whereas the Jewes object: God hath created a new thing in the earth: <hi>A woman ſhall compaſſe a man;</hi> and moſt carnally and curſedly ſay: Is this a New thing for a woman to be with child? It is the ordinarieſt, and commoneſt matter in the world.</p>
                        <p>I anſwer. Theſe obſtinate Jewes conſider not, that the novelty conſiſteth not in this, that a woman was with child: but this was the greateſt new thing in the world, that a virgin without the helpe of a man ſhould be with child. <hi>Adam</hi> came into the world without the helpe either of man or woman; <hi>Eve</hi> of a man without any ayde from any woman: other men not without the helpe both of man and woman: The Neweſt thing, the greateſt wonder was, Chriſt was to come, and did come of a pure Virgin without the helpe of Man.</p>

<pb n="235" facs="tcp:47497:138"/>ſpoken (ſaith <hi>Aquin.</hi> 3. <hi>parte. Quaeſt.</hi> 15.) as if the Centurions faith were won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull to other men; and in regard of other mens faith: Not in reſpect of Chriſt himſelfe. Let me adde. Sure it is, that Chriſt infuſed that faith into the Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion, and therefore muſt needs know it: In the Schoole termes take it thus, Chriſt as God knew all things; Chriſt as Man, and conſidered as a Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, had <hi>Cognitionem facialem,</hi> and was not ignorant: the ſame Chriſt as hee was <hi>Viator</hi> had knowledge infuſed, which was great: and acquired knowledge alſo in matters experimentall; Nor can he bee blamed for having ſome Neſciencie, ſince <hi>Ignorantia negativa non habet formale peccati:</hi> Negative ignorance hath not the formality of ſinne.</p>
                        <p>A ſecond anſwer is, indeed commonly among men <hi>Admirans dubitat,</hi> He that wondreth, doubteth: <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith ſo in the firſt of his Metaphyſicks. And ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration groweth from precedent Neſcience; yet Chriſts divine knowledge could not wonder, nor his infuſed knowledge: but the experimentall knowledge in Chriſt might wonder. <hi>Thus did he learne obedience by the things he ſuffered, Heb.</hi> 5.8. and therefore knew them not before.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith, <hi>Admiramur propriè magna,</hi> wee properly admire great things. And therefore the Centurions faith being great, Chriſt is ſaid to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; Not as if any thing were ſtrange to Chriſt: but becauſe thereby He did ſtir up thoſe that followed him, to wonder at his faith: tacitly recommending the like great faith unto them.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, he is ſaid to wonder, as he is ſaid to be angry; not properly, but <hi>per</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">

Againe, though the reſt of the fore-named Scriptures ſeeme to imply Chriſts Neſciencie, yet indeed they do not: Chriſt was ignorant of nothing, though he propounded many queſtions, for he queſtioned many matters, and ſeemed a learner, whilſt hee intended to teach; and I am bould to ſay, that, nor <hi>Solomon,</hi> nor <hi>Adam</hi> himſelfe, nor the beſt, and skilfuleſt of men put to them, could co-equall the knowledge of Chriſt. <hi>Lord thou knoweſt all things. Iohn</hi> 21.17. When he ſaid to his Apoſtles: <hi>How many loaves have yee? Goe and ſee: Mark</hi> 6.38. It is ſaid indeed there, <hi>When they knew:</hi> which words argue, they knew not before: But no ſuch word is ſaid of Chriſt.

                        <p>I anſwer briefly, That Chriſt did not curſe the tree in any anger: nor was the tree ſenſible of the curſe.

                        <p>Ieſus being wearied with his journey, ſaid to the woman of <hi>Samaria, Give me to drinke;</hi> for his Diſciples were gone away unto the Citie, to buy meat. <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we read that the woman left her water-pot, <hi>verſ.</hi> 28.

Chriſt did eate after his Reſurrection; and wee read that the Angels did eate meate, and after the ſame manner, not in a fained and emptie phantaſie: but in moſt apparent truth. Not by neceſſity: but by power. The thirſty ground drinkes up the water one way: the hot rayes of the Sunne conſume it another way. That through need, or want; This through power.

                        <p>LAſtly, (ſaith <hi>Illyricus,</hi>) Two reaſons, and thoſe not contemptible ones, may be drawn from the nature, and ſite of the countreyes why we are not bound to Faſt as the Iewes were.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Firſt, here in Germanie our ſtomacks for the circumſtant cold, yea na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally are hotter; and therefore conſume more meate: and can leſſe endure hunger.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The ſecond re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>aſon is; Since cold doth more afflict the Faſting, then the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:47497:144"/>full ſtomacks, or men; if a man would here macerate himſelfe with much Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, without doubt in thoſe ſo great colds he would dye, or fall into ſome moſt grievous diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>Some have made their belly their God; I dare ſay this ſuper intendent <hi>Illyricus</hi> may be his high-Prieſt. How tender is he of his God? They were never more carefull to provide for Baall, then he doth for the belly.</p>
                        <p>To the firſt reaſon, I ſay it is ridiculous. For becauſe they are more hungry naturally, or accidentally then the Iewes, ſhall they leſſe afflict themſelves, then the Iewes did? If they take away from their dyer but ſo much as may humble them; as may tame their rebellious fleſh, or may further them in the wayes of devotion, this is a true and acceptable Faſt, though before and after their Faſts, the Northerne ſtomack eate more meate, then the Eaſterne can. Againe, if the German can leſſe indure hunger; yet let him indure ſome: let him indure but proportionable affliction, as the Iewes did: or as God intendeth in his precept of Faſting: and then his after-eating is of eaſier diſpenſation.</p>
                        <p>To the ſecond reaſon I anſwer, <hi>Illyricus</hi> is very cautelous, very curious <hi>in cute curandâ,</hi> in pampering his belly: For though cold weather more puniſh the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, then the full and crammed paunch; yet, nor God, nor good men did ever command us, to macerate our ſelves with Faſting, ſo eagerly, ſo vehemently, ſo extreamely, as ſhould bring us either to death or diſeaſes, who do ſo willingly; are murtherers of themſelves: and if any ſhould do ſo unwillingly, hee is acceſſary to his owne death, and incurreth the wrath of God, for drawing ſickneſſe upon himſelfe. The golden meane is a juſt tribute, due to God, payable to man.</p>
                        <p>In ſome other matters concerning Faſting, <hi>Illyricus</hi> ſo playeth the Dy-dapper up and downe, in and out: that he is not worth the following; Yet I cannot who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give him over. He denyeth that Faſting conduceth to Prayer: or is a good worke of it ſelfe, but is onely a ſigne, and effect of a ſorrowfull, humbled and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite heart. And if any object; why did Chriſt then Faſt; even hee who had no ſinnes, for which he ſhould be ſorry? Why did the Apoſtles Faſt? <hi>Act.</hi> 13.3. of whom we do not read (ſaith <hi>Illyricus</hi>) that then lately they had committed any great ſinnes, for which they ſhould cruciate themſelves with griefe, and faſting? <hi>Illyricus</hi> anſwereth; Chriſt did not Faſt to prepare himſelfe to Prayer, ſince his fleſh did not rebell againſt his ſpirit; nor needed any ſuch caſtigation: But he fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted for griefe of minde, and contrition of heart: becauſe he was to be puniſhed, as if he had committed all the ſins of the world. I reply, did Chriſt Faſt only then, when he had ſuch dolorous thoughts? Did He not Faſt to teach us to Faſt? Either before, or in, or after his fortie dayes Faſt, is there any word evincing, that Chriſt faſted in conſideration of a moſt dolefull and broken heart? Likewiſe concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Apoſtles, All (ſaith hee) that adde faſting to Prayers, and pray rightly, muſt come with a broken heart: and then deſire mercie for Chriſts merit. Who denyeth this wholy? or what is this to the purpoſe? or how is the objection an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered? The Apoſtles, and others faſted, and prayed that God would bleſſe them in the calling, to which they were then ſeparated; and to obtaine the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, for that eſpeciall buſineſſe, though then they had no extraordinary cauſe to have broken hearts, as <hi>Illyricus</hi> confeſſeth: and no queſtion but they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored Gods mercie for Chriſts ſake; but their faſtings, and Prayers were not here ſignes, or effects of broken hearts: but <hi>Signanter,</hi> faſting ayded Prayer; Prayer faſting: both deſired, and obtained a bleſſing of God upon what they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted.</p>
                        <p>Moſt times a broken heart preceedeth faſting: Sometimes faſting prepareth the way to a broken heart: as the chewing of meate doth to the ſpeedier nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; As in our late, juſt, holy, and commanded Faſt, that the Lord would vouchſafe to free the Citie of London, and the infected neighbouring places, from the plague: many a thouſand countrey-men by faſting came to a ſorrowfull heart, who at firſt came not to a faſting by a contrite heart, but by command.</p>

And truely, as God doth often commute the eternall puniſhment, which wee have deſerved into a temporary: ſo, when hee ſeeth the inward humiliation of the ſoule, attended on with ſelfe-inflicted paine upon the body, the Lord doth take off ſome of that puniſhment which otherwiſe had laid ſtrong hold on us. This was <hi>Ahabs</hi> caſe, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 21.27. and the Ninevites, <hi>Jonah</hi> 3.7. whoſe volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſubjecting themſelves to puniſhment, diverted from them the full viols of Gods wrath.

Hold man, hold, though thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter hold, that when a man hath eaten moderately, he is fitter to receive the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion then when he is faſting; becauſe after meate the head is more purged; the mouth cleaner, the breath ſweeter: yet I dare ſay, the head is fuller of noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome fumes, the mouth no cleaner when one hath eaten: and if thy breath ſtink, common food maketh it no ſweeter, then the Divine Euchariſt: I am ſure the third Councill of <hi>Carthage, Canone</hi> 29. hath decreed: <hi>

Which truth is confirmed divinely, by our ſacred Liturgi—<hi>If any of you be a blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer of God, &amp;c.</hi>—unto theſe words—<hi>ſo ſhall yee be meete partakers of theſe holy myſteries,</hi> when Chriſt ſaid. <hi>Come unto me all yee that are heavie laden</hi>—he meant not, with loads of unrepented ſinnes, for, as ſuch cannot move one foot toward Chriſt; to ſuch obſtinate ſinners Chriſt is a judge and condemner: not a mercifull Saviour: And the words cannot aime at that ſenſe: for then not onely the ſpirituall food in the Sacrament, but even Chriſt ſhould bee the great allurer unto ſinne, as being abettor thereof, which God forbid: for then not onely a window, but a doore were ſet open to all iniquity and villany: but the meaning of that moſt comfortable invitatory, is, and muſt be, this: All yee who have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and are heartily ſorry for your offences, wearied, groaning, and ready to faint under griefe, for the ſame: yea, who finde no comfort in your ſelves, but are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be ſwallowed up of deſpaire, or too much (not ſinnes) but ſorrow for ſins, <hi>O come yee unto me:</hi> and this is evidenced by the gratious promiſe, <hi>I will refreſh you,</hi> refreſhing, being oppoſed to trembling, dejectedneſſe, weakeneſſe, ſwownings, trepidations, grievings, faintings, which are fruits of the heavie-hearted ſinner,

So <hi>Matt.</hi> 13.16. <hi>Bleſſed are your eyes, for they ſee: and your eares for they heare:</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to his Apoſtles) <hi>for many Prophets and righteous men have deſired to ſee the things which yee ſee, and have not ſeene them, and to heare thoſe things which yee
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:47497:147"/>heare, and have not heard them. verſ.</hi> 17. It is varied excellently, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.24. <hi>Prophets and Kings:</hi> So the Kings were reckoned as righteous men, more righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous than others.</p>
                        <p>Againe (ſaith <hi>Illyricus</hi>) God would not have rejected the faſts of the <hi>Jewes, Eſay</hi> 58.3. If they had beene exerciſes truly preparing men to prayer, and other vertues.</p>
                        <p>I anſwer: how blinde is hee that will not, or cannot ſee, that God findeth fault not with true faſting, which much conduceth to holineſſe: but with their Hypocriticall faſting. <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>in the day of your faſt yee finde</hi> (perhaps invent) <hi>pleaſure; yee offer grievances: yee faſt for strife and debate. verſ.</hi> 4. Then he ſheweth what a faſt God likes, <hi>verſ,</hi> 6. And after ſuch a faſt. <hi>Thou ſhalt call, and the Lord ſhall anſwer: thou ſhalt cry, and hee ſhall ſay, here am I. verſ.</hi> 9. Where the Prophet of ſet purpoſe ſheweth, that a true faſt prepareth men to pray, and God to heare. God found fault with the abuſe, and not with the right uſe of faſting. And ſhall we cut downe the vines, becauſe ſome are drunke? God never reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted a true faſt. <hi>When yee faſted and mourned, did ye at all faſt unto mee, even to mee? Zach.</hi> 7 5. Here is both faſting and mourning: yet becauſe they did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the waies of God, or godlineſſe, but faſted to their owne profane, and civill ends, and not to holy ends, or exerciſes of piety; God renounceth them.</p>
                        <p>Againe (ſaith hee) Chriſt faſted; whoſe body needed no ſuch caſtigation. Therefore hee did not prepare himſelfe by faſting unto prayer. I anſwer. Indeed Chriſt was the immaculate lambe of God, without either originall or actuall ſin. But he faſted to ſatisfie <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eves</hi> intemperate eating, he faſted to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence our gluttony, he faſted ſo, to teach us to faſt. And hee faſted for us, not for himſelfe; If he faſted that needed not, how much rather ought wee to faſt, that do need? Chriſt faſted not without great good cauſes; and to great good ends, and purpoſes, &amp; the iſſue was divine. For had he made bread of ſtone: had hee eate that bread, had hee not ſtill faſted, hee had beene ſurpriſed by the tempter, but by faſting hee grew hungry.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Graeculus eſuriens, in coelum juſſer is, ibit.</hi> A man will do any thing, to ſatisfie na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, if his appetite be ſharpe ſet; hunger will breake through ſtone walls; yet whereas <hi>Adam,</hi> and all wee in him fell by his eating: our bleſſed Saviour ſtood out againſt Satan, and over came him by hunger and faſting: as I have manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in my <hi>Miſcellanies.</hi> I deny not the conjunction of other helpes, for Chriſt. Chriſt in the dayes of his fleſh, when hee offered up prayers, and ſupplications, with ſtrong crying, and teares: he was heard for his piety; or in that he feared, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. But in the tempting Chriſt to eate, did the ſerpents head worke chiefly; and it was the maine drift of Satans firſt great temptation.</p>

                        <p>But <hi>Daniel</hi> 10.3. it is ſo defined. I anſwer, it is not: it is true <hi>Daniel</hi> mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned three weekes: and as true that he did eate no pleaſant bread; neither came fleſh or wine into his mouth: neither did hee annoint himſelfe at all, till the whole three weekes were fulfilled; yet might hee eate other bread, and other food<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though coſtly or curious food, hee ate not. <hi>Illyricus</hi> might have remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, that becauſe <hi>Daniel</hi> did chaſten himſelfe before his God: his words (or prayers) were heard, <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. Therefore his faſting prepared him to prayer, and other exerciſes of devotion: and prepared God to bleſſe all.</p>
                        <p>But faſting is defined to be a mourning, <hi>Zach.</hi> 7.5. <hi>When yee faſted and mourned.</hi> I anſwer, Here faſting precedeth mourning: where <hi>Illyricus</hi> ſaith
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:47497:147"/>Faſting is an effect of mourning, and naturally floweth from it: when it is commanded, <hi>Watch and Pray,</hi> is one a definition of the other: becauſe they be conjoynd? Faſting and mourning be two diſtinct things, and fall not under one definition.</p>

                        <p>THeſe be his arguments, which hee thinkes ſtrong enough to withhold him from ſubſcribing to thoſe, who thinke, faſtings of old were, and now are to be uſed, that the macerated bodie may better obey the ſoule, and that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian may be apter to pray, and to all divine exerciſes.</p>
                        <p>But <hi>Illyricus</hi> objecteth againſt himſelfe. Are faſtings wholly unprofitable? Why are they then ſo often conjoyned with prayers, if they be not exerciſes preparing to prayers?</p>
                        <p>Hee anſwereth. Since theſe afflictions of faſting are undertaken by the prime motion of nature in great griefe of minde: and then confirmed by cuſtome in the eaſterne countries: it came to paſſe, that they did both faſt and pray in troubles. Nature, cuſtome, chance, are his grounds for faſting, and prayer: Not God, not Scriptures, not holy examples precedent: theſe are nothing to the frothy German.</p>
                        <p>Moreover (ſaith hee) the calling upon God was their onely remedie for all their evils: therefore they alwaies added earneſt prayers to their afflictions that their ſinnes might be remitted and the puniſhments averted.</p>
                        <p>Is calling upon God the onely remedy? Did not faith, and contrition, and repentance precede? Doth not faſting accompany? Shall wee exclude hope? renounce charity? and make prayer to be the onely remedy? Thus forſooth in ſome other humors, Faith alone ſaveth: onely faith; <hi>Fides ſola, &amp; ſolitaria.</hi> Yet all Noveliſts muſt know; They ſhall ſooner ſeparate light from the Sunne, heate from the fire: then they ſhall ſeparate faith, true faith, ſaving faith from Charity, from Hope; from the feare and love of God, or from other Theologicall vertues.</p>

                        <p>At all times great hath beene the ſuperſtition, and abuſe of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, and of other afflictions thereunto annexed. Yet was there not one cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine forme of that faſt: for it was free and voluntary, and therefore out of doubt, one did cruciate himſelfe otherwiſe, than others did.</p>
                        <p>And yet himſelfe truly confeſſeth, they fed on no dainties: But that is one certaine forme (ſay I) And he confeſſeth further: To faſt is to abſtaine from the chiefe commodities of the body; and to draw diſcommodities upon a mans ſelfe. To abſtaine from meate, drinke, ſleepe, waſhing, annointing, change of apparell, muſicke, mirth, and all recreations: yea to put on ſordid, and ill appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, which they call ſackcloth, to lye on the ground, on aſhes, duſt or any other ſordid place.</p>
                        <p>His very definition preſcribeth this forme, and accordingly was it uſed: and yet he denyeth any one certaine forme. That ſome faſted longer, or oftner, or ſtricter than others, none will deny; but all did afflict their ſoules, or otherwiſe it was no true faſt. Whereas hee ſaith, it was free and voluntary: no man can deny, but ſome had more occaſion than others had, and did faſt whën others did not; yes, and faſted voluntarily: yet himſelfe confeſſeth they were comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to faſt on the daies of expiation. <hi>Levit.</hi> 23.27. <hi>Yee ſhall afflict your ſoules.</hi> And the Prophet gave precepts for faſting: which in like caſe we are to imitate. Chriſt foretold the Apoſtles ſhould faſt. Chriſt ſaid; <hi>When yee faſt annoint your heads:</hi> implying that men were to faſt.</p>
                        <p>I ſee faſting is commanded in the Old and New Teſtament, but what daies we are to faſt, and not to faſt, by precept from God, or his Apoſtles I finde not. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine, Epiſt.</hi> 88. <hi>ad Caſularum.</hi> Yet in that Tractate hee doth very well confute ſuch as ſay, of old faſting was no other than a temperate and ſober life. His rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is excellent. <hi>Moſes, Elias, Daniel, Chriſt,</hi> and his Apoſtles, who queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe alwaies lived temperately, and ſoberly; yet even they did faſt certaine daies. Againe (ſaith hee) It is eaſie to diſcerne from 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.12. where they mourned, and wept, and faſted untill even. from <hi>Daniel,</hi> 10.2. and from <hi>Ionah</hi> 3.5 &amp;c. that faſting is a more ſowre, ſorrowfull and hard thing, than a temperate, and ſober life.</p>

                        <p>IN the middle Tractate, <hi>De efficiente cauſa jejunii;</hi> Thus hee diſcourſeth, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, <hi>Omnibus animalibus incitum eſt,</hi> it is given to all living creatures; not onely to live, but to live contentedly, and ſweetly: and to procure pleaſing things; and to fly the contrary. But in great ſorrows men lead a diſcontented life, and deſire to die; and therefore begin to neglect all things, belonging to an happy life. And in greater ſorrow beate their breaſts, teare their faces, and haire, as in the Southerne parts women were wont to do. Theſe ſorrowes are not fitly ordered by <hi>Illyricus.</hi> The ſorrow which cauſeth men to deſire death, is greater than that, when people beate their breaſts: teare away the haire from their
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:47497:148"/>heads, and skinnes from their face. But I muſt remember my promiſed brevity. Hee returneth to his firſt poſition. When wee are glad, wee naturally love this life, and the things te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nding to it: and when wee are ſorry, wee hate life: fly the preſence of men, and pleaſures; yea embrace things diſcommodious. Yet cuſtome much prevaileth in this point; for ſome people teſtifie their joy, and ſorrow otherwiſe, both by the quantity and quality, than others doe.</p>
                        <p>Then defineth hee thus. Faſting is (in the holy Scriptures) a certaine afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the body, and an outward ſigne, and effect of a minde inwardly ſorrowfull. or, a certaine outward mourning, which voluntarily, yet by a naturall motion, is undertooke whilſt the ſoule mourneth. The efficient cauſe of faſting is (ſaith hee) plainly naturall: though both will and cuſtome, doe ſome way concurre unto it. His concluſion runneth to this e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nd: that the torments or macerations of Faſtings, may, and uſe to ariſe from great ſorrow of the minde, from a broken and contrite heart, from the humiliation and proſtration of the ſoule. Thus much (ſaith hee) of the efficient cauſe of faſting. Yet certainly ſome, if not many faſt, not out of any great precedent ſorrow, or naturall motion: but from the motion of grace, from a willing minde to prevent evils, either of ſinne, or puniſhment, to obtaine Gods favour in things they deſire, to tame their bodies, to prepare themſelves for prayer, and holy exerciſes of devotion, to helpe the afflicted ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neere or farre off, to ſhew obedience to the Magiſtrate; and by faſting to humble themſelves more than when they began to faſt; and more than they would have beene humbled, if they had not faſted, to procure a bleſſing upon ſuch great and difficult affaires as they intend to compaſſe, and to adapt the minde to ſpirituall conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mplations. Experience proveth all this. Faſting-ſpittle, Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> calleth <hi>Virginem ſalivam,</hi> perhaps you may terme, <hi>Virgineam ſalivam,</hi> Virgin-ſpittle, and is in it ſelfe more powerfull than any other ſpittle.</p>

Faſting is the imitation of Angels, as farre as lyeth in us, a contempt of pleaſant things, a ſchoole of prayer, a bridle for the mouth, and a tamer of concupiſcence. It ſlacketh fury, curbeth wrath, appeaſeth the inſurrection of nature, quickeneth reaſon, lighteth the fleſh, drives away filthy nightly intemperance. It hath revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Gods ſentence, and ſtopped the execution of his judgements.

                        <p>MY propounded method leadeth mee now, to examine in the ſecond place, what ſeverall. Evangelaſts wrote, concerning the ſeverall Suppers. Which beeing cleered, much confuſion will be chaſed away, and the greateſt dubious matters, will diſtinctly appeare.</p>
                        <p>S. <hi>Matthew Chapter</hi> 26. ſpeaketh of the Paſſeover from <hi>v.</hi> 17. to the 25. <hi>incluſivê.</hi>

                        <p>Saint <hi>Marke Chapter</hi> 14. doth the like from <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. to <hi>verſ</hi> 21. <hi>incluſivê,</hi> alſo.</p>
                        <p>Saint <hi>Luke Chapter</hi> 22.7. beginneth a large narrative, from the beginning of the preparation, to the Supper it ſelfe; and at the 14. verſe the continuance of that Supper till the 19. <hi>verſ. excluſivè.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Paſſeover which the three Evangeliſts had deſcribed ſo fully, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> omitteth; and toucheth onely at the heele, or end of that Supper. <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.2. Supper being ended: <hi>viz.</hi> the Supper of the Paſchall lambe. For neither was the ſacred ſupper then inſtituted, or begunne, much leſſe ended: No nor yet was the Common ſupper; during which ſo many matters of moment were acted: (of which hereafter:) and therefore the words muſt be underſtood of the ending of Paſchall.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the ſecond Supper, the common, or ordinary Supper, Saint <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> ſaid nothing: and Saint <hi>Marke</hi> nothing.

                        <p>Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> writing laſt, and ſeeing memorable paſſages omitted in the ſecond ſupper, hee onely points at the paſſeover, making the end of it to be the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the ſecond ſupper. Nor doth hee mention, or ſo much as point at the third ſupper at all; becauſe it was throughly diſcribed by all the other three Evangeliſts: but applyeth himſelfe wholy to a large, and full explanation of things done, and words ſpoken at the ſecond ſupper. <hi>Iohn</hi> 13. from <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. to the 30. <hi>verſ.</hi> incluſively.</p>

                        <p>COncerning the Supper of the Lord, it is apparent, that it was not be begunne till after the ſecond ſupper, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.25. <hi>In the ſame manner hee tooke the Cup when hee had ſupped. Likewiſe alſo, hee tooke the cup, After Supper. Luk.</hi> 22.20. So the firſt ſupper was ended; and then began the ſecond. And after the ſecond ſupper was ended; that is, when <hi>Iudas</hi> was gone forth (of which hereafter) when it was night, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.20. and after ſome little diſcourſe, from <hi>verſe</hi> 31. to <hi>verſe</hi> 38. <hi>incluſivè:</hi> Chriſt inſtituted his laſt, beſt, holieſt Supper of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt.

                        <p>The third ſupper is deſcribed from <hi>Matthew</hi> 26.26. to part of the 30. <hi>verſe</hi> incluſively from <hi>Marke</hi> 22. to part of the 26. <hi>verſe,</hi> incluſively alſo.

                           <hi>PAR. 3.</hi> The ſecond Supper. The third particular of the firſt Generall.</head>
                        <p>ANd now two of thoſe points which I thought fit to be premiſed being done; I come to handle the third and laſt <hi>puncto,</hi> or <hi>praelibandum.</hi> And it conſiſteth in the anſwers to this queſtion: Why there is no expreſſe mention of a ſecond ſupper?</p>
                        <p>I am bold to ſay, expreſſe mention is not neceſſary. A thouſand matters of weight, and moment have beene paſſed over without expreſſe mention: yet really have beene performed, and are moſt true of their owne nature. <hi>Moſes</hi> paſſed over the creation of Angels, and Archangels, and the innumerable glorious hoſts of heavenly incorporeall ſpirits, and doth not ſo much as once name them: whence the <hi>Sadduces</hi> belike did gather, that there are neither Angels nor Spirits.</p>
                        <p>No expreſſe mention is there of baptizing of infants, or many other matters. Conſequentiall and inferentiall Divinity, if truly, and unforcedly collected, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be diſapproved. <hi>Quae colliguntur ex Scripturis, perinde habenda ſunt, ac ſi in illis ſcripta eſſent. Greg. Nazianzenus Theologiae, lib.</hi> 5. You are to eſteeme ſuch things as are gathered out of the Scriptures, as thoſe that are written in them. <hi>Quae in divinis Scripturis non ſunt ſcripta, tractare debemus per ea quae ſcripta ſunt,</hi> ſayth <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigen in Matth. cap.</hi> 23. Thoſe things which are not written in ſacred Scriptures, muſt be handled or explained by thoſe things that are there written. <hi>Auguſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus contra Mendacium ad Conſentium: cap.</hi> 10. <hi>In divinis Scripturis vera aliquando tacentur, non mentiendo, ſed tacendo.</hi> Many true things are concealed in Scripture not by lying, but by omiſſion or ſilence.</p>
                        <p>From thoſe things that are written, we muſt (ſaith the Divine Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi>) gather ſuch things that are not written. In the whole booke of <hi>Heſter</hi> there is not the name of the Father, Sonne, or Holy Spirit, No nor ſo much as the name of God; yet manifeſt effects are there of the divine providence, juſtice and mercy of God. In the whole Scriptures, there is not, <hi>in expreſſis terminis,</hi> a men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Unity in Trinity: or Trinity in Unity: yet the deductions naturally flowing are moſt evident for it.</p>
                        <p>Thus though there be no expreſſe mention of Angels in the Hiſtory of the Creation: yet by reſultance, the hidden truth is inlightned; the concealed do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is revealed.</p>
                        <p>Some of the Fathers, becauſe no ſuch is named in the ſtory of the Creation, have held that the Angels were created before the world: as <hi>Hieron.</hi> in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary on the Epiſtle to <hi>Titus</hi> 1.2. from the words. <hi>God promiſed eternall life, before the wold began.</hi> If any who beſides the Angels? Therefore the Angels were before the world beganne.</p>

                              <item>3 Why may I not ſay, if the words were taken litterally for promiſe, it is an holy trialogiſme, of the Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghoſt before the foundations of the world, ſweetly concording and promiſing eternall life to mankinde, though man was not as yet created.</item>

Ludovicus Vives,</hi> on <hi>Auguſtine de Civitate Dei,</hi> 11.9. ſaith.

<pb n="259" facs="tcp:47497:150"/>theſe. Others ran into another extreme, that the Angels were created af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the world; as the ſoule of man was after his body, So <hi>Gennadius</hi> and <hi>Acatius.</hi> Yet <hi>Beda, Caſſiodorus,</hi> and others are peremptory that the Angels were created within the ſixe dayes. And they followed the Divine S. <hi>Aug.</hi> for after <hi>Aug.</hi> almoſt all the <hi>Latines</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ludovicus Vives de Civitate.</hi> 10.9.) and ſince them all the Schooles ſay: all the Angels were created within the ſixe dayes. I boldly ſay; <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16. By Chriſt were all things created, that are in heaven &amp; earth, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: hee might have ſpecialized Angels or Archangels, Cherubims, or Seraphims, ſince hee added: Al things were made by him and for him.</p>
                        <p>What ſome ſaid of <hi>Origen,</hi> I may ſay concerning thoſe <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers, that they rather <hi>Platonize,</hi> than <hi>Chriſtianize:</hi> for <hi>Plato</hi> long before them in his booke <hi>de mundi opificio,</hi> held the ſame opinion. The reaſoning of <hi>Auguſtine de Civitate Dei,</hi> 11.9. is good. That the creation of Angels is not left out only by <hi>Moſes,</hi> I thinke by this (ſaith he) it is ſaid expreſly: God ended his worke on the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, and hee reſted the ſeaventh day from all his workes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.2. And, <hi>In the beginning God created the Heaven, and the earth, Gen.</hi> 1.1. Now if he made nothing before the ſixe dayes, and reſted from all his worke the ſeaventh day, then the Angels muſt needes be created within that time. But yet there is a plaine place, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.11. though it be not ſufficiently expreſſed without ſome deduction. <hi>In ſixe dayes the Lord made Heaven and Earth, the Sea and all that in them is.</hi> The Angels are in heaven, and on earth: (This is the aſſumption.) Therefore in the ſixe dayes they were created. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 146.6. It is varied ſomewhat, <hi>God made Heaven and Earth, the Sea, and all that therein is.</hi> From whence you may extract the ſame concluſion. As man was created when all things were fitted for him: and the ſoule is infuſed into the body, when the body is prepared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it: ſo as ſoone as the Heavens, the Angels <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, now framed, the Lord filled it with Angels.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, it is ſaid, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 148.2. <hi>Praiſe the Lord all yee Angels of his:</hi> the reaſon is added in the fifth verſe, <hi>Let them praiſe the name of the Lord, for hee ſpake the word, and they were made, hee commanded, and they were created,</hi> not onely Sun and Moone, not onely Starres of light, not onely heavens of heavens, and the waters above the heavens: but Angels alſo; and firſt of all are Angels placed, when hee had formerly ſaid: Praiſe the Lord from the heavens; And ſo are they comprized as well as other creatures within the ſixe dayes compaſſe of the creation.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in the forecited booke and chapter argueth from the ſong of the three children, in the midſt of the fire (though it be <hi>Apocrypha</hi> tous) for in the 34. <hi>verſe</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>All yee workes of the Lord, bleſſe yee the Lord:</hi> and in the next verſe, <hi>O yee heavens, bleſſe yee the Lord:</hi> the ſubſequent verſe hath it: <hi>O yee An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of the Lord, bleſſe yee the Lord:</hi> as if they were created, and indeed ſo they were, ſo ſoone as their habitation was made; and God had fitted them a dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling place. But that was done towards the beginning of the creation: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Angels were then created.</p>
                        <p>Againe, though there be not expreſſe mention <hi>(in iiſdem terminis ſic terminan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus)</hi> In plaine words and diſert termes; of baptizing of infants, yet the Church juſtly, profitably, and excellently obſerveth it. And thus it may be evinced by Scripture.</p>
                        <p>In the Apoſtles time they did baptize whole houſholds, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.16. <hi>I bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized the houſe of Stephanas. Lydia</hi> was baptized, and her houſhold, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.15. So the Jaylor was baptized, hee and all his ſtreight way, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. <hi>verſe</hi> 33. that is, his children, as well as his houſhold ſervants: <hi>Act:</hi> 2: 38. <hi>Be baptized every one of you.</hi>—<hi>For the promiſe is made to you, and to your children, verſ.</hi> 39. This were a ſilly reaſon, if children might not be baptized: but indeed it is a ſtrong motive, that they ſhould bring their children to Baptiſme, and an argument
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:47497:151"/>faire enough, that children were baptized: for thoſe to whom the promiſe is made muſt be baptized: but the promiſe is made as much to children as to any others, therefore children ought to be baptized. Certainly the Apoſtles would never have named their children, if none of them had any children, but the converts in that place being ſome thouſands, it could not be otherwiſe, but many of them had children, yea and that their children were baptized with themſelves: as in the ſame day was <hi>Abraham</hi> circumciſed, and <hi>Iſhmael</hi> his ſonne, and all the men of his houſhold, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.26. For otherwiſe hee had beene diſobedient to the holy Apoſtle, who ſaid: <hi>Be baptized every one of you:</hi> But no good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an will or can thinke, that thoſe then converted were diſobedient, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their children were baptized.</p>
                        <p>It is a ridiculous thing to thinke the Apoſtles choſe out ſuch houſholds only, as had no little infants in them, leaving great and numerous families unbaptized, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome little children were in them. And fairelier we may conclude. In many families there were ſome infants. But many whole families were baptized: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome infants. If ſome, why not others? If others, why not all? And ſo all infants are to be baptized. Againe, Baptiſme is neceſſary for us, as Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was for the Jewes. This is proved becauſe of the correſpondence betweene the Type and Antitype, which correſpondency is ſo ſquare and perfect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Old and New Sacrament, that the Apoſtle 2.11.12. in effect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigneth out Baptiſme, by the name of Circumciſion. But their infants were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.27. and therefore our infants muſt be Baptized: <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41. In one day were added to the Church about 3000 ſoules, yea daily the Lord ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſuch to the Church as ſhould be ſaved, <hi>verſ.</hi> 47. but children are ſome of thoſe that muſt be ſaved, <hi>for of ſuch is the Kingdome of God,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.13. It is added <hi>Mark</hi> 10.15. <hi>verſe. Verily I ſay unto you, Whoſoever ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Kingdome of God as a little child, hee ſhall not enter therein.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Laſtly, leſt any ſhould cavill, theſe children were not very little, but ſuch as came of themſelves unto Chriſt, it is ſaid in the ſame verſe of Saint <hi>Matthew; They brought little children unto him:</hi> and ſome of thoſe children ſo brought were infants, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.15. <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>: it being ſignificantly tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in our beſt and laſt tranſlation: <hi>They brought unto him alſo infants.</hi> Therefore infants according to Chriſts, yea the Apoſtles practiſe muſt be baptized. For there is no likelihood, but in ſuch great multitudes, as were together baptized, and divers day by day, but there were ſome infants.</p>

                        <p>The ſecond Supper is not to be thought a fancie, becauſe the word Second is not expreſſed.</p>
                        <p>The Scripture is not tyed to termes of method or number. <hi>I have many things to ſay,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.26. <hi>I have yet many things to ſay unto you; Iohn</hi> 16.12. <hi>but yee cannot beare them now.</hi> So Chriſt ſpake not all things, but concealed ſome. Likewiſe alſo Chriſt Jeſus did many other ſignes, and them truly in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his Diſciples, which are not written in this booke: <hi>Iohn</hi> 20.30. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this <hi>Iohn</hi> 21, 25. <hi>There are alſo many other things which Ieſus did, which if they ſhould be written</hi> (every one in particular) <hi>I ſuppoſe the world it ſelfe could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the bookes which ſhould be writeen.</hi> But leſt theſe words may leave a ſcruple in mens conſciences, they are to know, that the world doth not comprehend here the whole earth, much leſſe heaven and earth, but is uſed for a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe onely, as ſome do opine. And they have a parallell. For it was promiſed to <hi>Abraham</hi> that hee ſhould be heire of the world, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.13. yet God gave him no inheritance, no not ſo much as to ſet his foot on. <hi>Act:</hi> 7.5. Neither had ever any, or all his children the hundreth part of the world. Therefore <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, world is to be taken in a more contracted ſence. It is ſaid, <hi>Their ſound is gone out into all lands, and their words into the end of the world, Rom:</hi> 10.10. and yet to this day
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:47497:151"/>the greateſt part of the world never heard of Chriſt: you are not to ſet the word <hi>World</hi> upon the tenter-hooks, but to interpret it more reſtrainedly, and ſtrictly in the above cited places. Rather a ſecond ſenſe is better: <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.30. <hi>The Prince of the World commeth</hi> (i.) of the wicked.</p>
                        <p>The world may be taken for the wicked ſort of men: <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.10. <hi>The World know him not. Iohn</hi> 14.17. <hi>The world cannot receive the Spirit of truth.</hi> So here it may be: <hi>The world it ſelfe cannot containe the bookes. Capere non poſſunt,</hi> is expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by, <hi>intelligere non poſſunt.</hi> And ſo <hi>Auguſtine, Theophylact, Rupertus,</hi> and <hi>Beda.</hi> For if the wicked did not comprehend (as they did not) all that himſelfe ſpake, or the Apoſtles, and Evangeliſts writ, they would not have underſtood them, though they had ſpoken, or writ much more. <hi>Capere,</hi> you muſt referre, <hi>non ad ſpatium loci, ſed ad animum:</hi> you muſt referre the word Containe, not to the ſpace of place, but of the minde, <hi>Mat:</hi> 19.11. <hi>All men cannot receive this ſaying:</hi> The ſame words both in <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greeke</hi> being in both places, and all runne to this, That they could not underſtand.

                           <item>3 It is apparent he did not goe about to deceive: for deceit hath falſe lights, falſe colours, falſe ſhadowes, <hi>Quorſum tegmen pellacidum?</hi> Hee dealeth plainly, hee would have made tryall in likelyer matters, if all truth had beene to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded according to the letter.

                        </list>
                        <p>More poſitively hee made uſe of this Hyperbole, to remove the aſperſion of Flattery, Oſcitancie and Negligencie of ſingularity, and of untruths, of each ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry briefly.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 Leaſt people might thinke hee had written already, more than was true, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe friends omit nothing in commendation of their friend, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> excuſeth himſelfe from flattery, becauſe hee omitted many things, yea a world of things. Hee wrote not partially as <hi>Philinus</hi> did for the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and <hi>Fabius</hi> for the <hi>Romans,</hi> for which both of them are juſtly taxed by <hi>Polybius.</hi> The holy Apoſtles not ſpake all, or wrote all that they could: <hi>intra veritatem ſteterunt:</hi> but fell purpoſely much ſhort of all the truth.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 Leſt people ſhould accuſe him of Oſcitancie and Neglect, in that hee wrote no more, but lets them know hee wrote enough, more was needleſſe, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly acquitteth them for not writing all which Chriſt ſaid, by affirming that his very workes exceeded all writing,</p>
                        <p n="3">3 For Singularity: to prevent this objection, Why do you paſſe by ſo many things, which the other Evangeliſts wrote; hee preſuppoſeth, that what any one wrote, was <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>Towards the end of the Paſchall Supper, or at the end of it, the Jewes uſually had a larger Supper, called a common ſupper, as <hi>Maimonides,</hi> and the Jewiſh Doctors confeſſe: which ſupper, though it was not injoyned at the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Paſſeover, when they were in ſo perplexed an eſtate, and in ſuch hurly-burly, that it was hard to ſay whether the Iewes or the Aegyptians moſt beſtirred themſelves, to haſten the Iſraelites abrupt departure: yet you ſhall finde it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly precepted: <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> 16.2. <hi>Thou ſhalt ſacrifize the Paſſeover unto the Lord thy God of the flocke and of the herd.</hi> The Lambe of the flocke was the proper Paſſeover, The beaſt of the herd were for the feſtivall refreſhments of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſupper; ſome of them, even the ſame night, as well as for the ſucceeding ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven daies. Yea it is moſt obſervable, that both the flocke and the herd are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and the order expreſſed.</p>

                        <p>Vaine are they then that thinke that they might eate none of the herd that night. With the Paſſeover indeed they might eate none: but ſo ſoone as the Rites of the Paſſeover were performed, they did eate of the herd, of which hereafter. Nor might they eate unleavened bread at either of thoſe ſuppers, or feaſts. For the Sacramentall ſupper was not ordeined meerly as naturall food at civill Feaſts; Every one preſent had ſome of it, but they made not their full meales on it: every one had a little, and with feare and reverence did they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the beginning of it.</p>
                        <p>Sacred things were ſparely and warily taken, and uſed in reſpect of their ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of ordinary food. As with us, the taking of the bleſſed body and blood of our Lord precedeth our uſuall refections at dinners, and is firſt eaten, <hi>propter honorem corporis Dominici:</hi> for the honour of the Lords body: as <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> excellently phraſeth it. So the ſacred partaking of the Paſchall Lambe, with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened bread, and ſowre hearbes was the antipaſt to their ſecond ſucceeding ſupper.</p>

Apparent then it is, that unto the ſacred offering of thankſgiving in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Paſchall ſacrifice, which was their firſt and devouter part of the night, there were to be added Peace-offrings, or Feaſt offerings, at the ſame time.</p>
                        <p>Unto the <hi>Paſcha</hi> was annexed the <hi>Chagigab.</hi> The herd did miniſter meat-offrings of more joy, and comfort, as it were at the ſecond courſe; as the flocke had done before of dovout thankeſgiving mingled partly of joy partly of ſoure ſorrow. For it is expreſſely ſaid, <hi>Deuteron.</hi> 16.4. <hi>Neither ſhall there any thing of the fleſh which thou ſacrificeſt the firſt day at even remaine all night, untill the morning.</hi> Where obſerve, they alſo ſacrificed the very firſt day at even, both of the flocke, and of the herd, as appeareth by the ſecond verſe: and they roſted the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over: ſome of the herd they did alſo boyle the ſame night. <hi>Deuteron.</hi> 16.7.

                        <p>The <hi>Iewes</hi> having but two ſuppers, and having libertie to eate as little as they would of the firſt, ſo they did eate ſome (and that ſome of the Paſchall was to be taken by tradition, and practice of the <hi>Iewes</hi> in no greater quantity than an Olive) and having no meate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or cates, but a little unleavened bread with diſtaſtfull ſauce in their ſecond ſupper, were poore feaſts in the firſt and great night of Paſchalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing ſolemnity. Let mee adde. The <hi>Paſcha</hi> might be eaten either at the firſt, or ſecond ſupper, or at any time of the night before the dawning of the day.</p>
                        <p>The Paſſeover was (that I may ſo ſpeake) the ſtanding diſh, for that nights Feſtivall. And I have read a tradition of the Jewes, that they cloſed their appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites by eating their laſt bit of the <hi>Paſcha,</hi> when they had ſatisfyed themſelves before, moſt of all with the <hi>Chagigah.</hi> For though the <hi>Chagigah</hi> was not to be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> brought to the Table, much leſſe to be eaten, till the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> firſt ſupper of the <hi>Paſcha</hi> was neere e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nded, or the greateſt part of it legally performed: (ſince Bread and Wine, the Roaſted Lambe, and ſowre hearbes, or ſauce, were the onely permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted food at the firſt, of which wee have ſpoken be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fore) yet when the ſecond

                        </p>
                        <p>That God ſhould ordaine a feaſt for his people, and let them have onely a pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the ſacred Typicall food, and goe away with hungry ſtomacks, is againſt the nature of a feaſt; eſpecially of the moſt wiſe, and indulgent God his appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.

                        <p>The firſt ſupper was ended, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.2. before the diſcourſe, and actions which followed; but after that, Chriſt riſeth from ſupper verſe 4. And ſits downe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine verſe 12. and did eate, and eate bread with <hi>Iudas</hi> verſe 18. Therefore this was the common and ſecond ſupper.

A flying thought ought not to diſturbe our devotion at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of ſo high a miſtery: neither would Chriſt give an example of ſo irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent an action during the adminiſtration of the Supper, of the holy Supper of the Lord. So it being neither the Paſchall, nor Euchariſticall ſupper, it muſt needs be the ſecond-common ſupper, from which Chriſt aroſe, and after returned to his old place, For hee did riſe from ſupper.</p>

The peices were about the bigneſſe of an Olive, which he gave to every one in order. When therefore the Maſter of the Family, was about to eate the dipped Bit, he praied; <hi>Bleſſed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the world, who haſt ſanctified us by thy Commandement, &amp;c.</hi> of which I ſpake before.

This was the Ceremony, and Rite of celebrating the Paſſeover, in the dayes, or time of the <hi>Miſſias;</hi> ſo farre the admired <hi>Scaliger. pag.</hi> 572. &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Yet me thinketh in this diſcription of the Paſchall Supper, ſomewhat redoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, much is deficient.</p>
                        <p>That they had an <hi>Embamma</hi> or ſallet, of divers other herbes at the firſt Paſchall Supper; and that they who had ſcarce leaſure to cooke their meate, and not leaſure to bake their bread, yet were ſo curious, as to have elaborated ſauces, ſtands not much with likelihood.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, was this <hi>Embamma</hi> more pleaſant, or diſpleaſant to the taſte, than the ſoure herbs onely? If they uſed it to adoulce, and ſweeten the ſoure-bitter taſte of the herbs, it defrauded the intent of the Law.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Beza,</hi> who borrowed of <hi>Scaliger</hi> much of that he had concerning the Paſchall Supper, skippeth over the ſpiſſitude of the ſauce, like muſtard: and ſaith the <hi>Embemma;</hi> (it ſhould have beene printed <hi>Embamma</hi>) was to temper the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſoureneſſe of the herbes, which is nothing elſe but to enſweeten them, and fit them for the pleaſantneſſe of the taſte, or pallat: But this is unlikely (as I ſaid) that it might be <hi>Satura olerum amarorum,</hi> full of ſoure herbes. Then I ſay, that addition needed not, ſince God appointed the former, and he knew what was beſt; and ſince all (that have taſted) doe know, and others may reade it, as confeſſed, that <hi>Lactuca Silvatica,</hi> or <hi>Silveſtris,</hi> wilde Lettice, is of an harſh taſte of it ſelfe, ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bitter for ſauce.</p>
                        <p>Againe, he ſaith; that this <hi>Embamma</hi> was of ſuch a nature, that they did dippe in it both their unleavened bread, and the bitter herbes. So by his reckoning, it was the ſauce, for the ſauce of herbes.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Things deficient in the diſcription of the Paſchall Feaſt uſed by</hi> Scaliger, <hi>are theſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. That he maketh the ſecond ſupper to conſiſt onely of unleavened bread, and wine given round to every gueſt, and ſinging of a laudatory hymne: and in the roome of ſweete-meates brings in his thicke ſauce, forgetting the meate of the herd, which was to be eaten with it, having bread to eate with that ſauce of herbes; and another ſauce into which both bread, and ſoure herbes were dipped.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That he maketh a double waſhing; firſt, from the daily uſe, that they might lye downe, and eate the paſchall Lambe. Secondly, Supper being done, they waſhed according to the Rite of the paſſeover, ſaith he, where he maketh the time of the ſecond waſhing, to be juſt at the end of the firſt Supper, or of the beginning of the Second Supper.</p>
                        <p>More plainely, yet he avoucheth. <hi>Duplex eſt Coena incontinenter, cum duae lotiones utramque praeeant;</hi> there was a double Supper forthwith joyning together with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpace betweene, incontinently; two waſhings preceding both of them (or rather one waſhing going before each of them) <hi>Barradius</hi> his argument well refuteth the opinion of <hi>Scaliger: Coenâ factâ ſurgit â coenâ</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>John</hi>) <hi>Si â coenâ ſurrexit jam diſcumbebat, &amp; coenabat. Non ergo ante coenum (illam) exhibita eſt pedibus aqua.</hi> After Supper, he roſe from Supper. If he roſe from Supper, he had before ſate downe, and had ſupped. Therefore (the Apoſtles) feete were not waſhed, before (that) Supper. <hi>Lucas Brugenſis Itinerary</hi> ſaith, that Chriſt, <hi>post agni eſum, &amp; coenam vulgarem, lavit pedes Apoſtolorum:</hi> after the Lambe was eaten, and the common ſupper, he waſhed his Apoſtles feete. As if <hi>Chriſt</hi> waſhed them when the ſecond Supper was ended (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oppoſite to <hi>Scaliger</hi>) yet it is apparent, <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſate downe againe, and againe did eate.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Auguſtine Tractatu in Johan.</hi> 55. reaſoneth as well againſt this extreme of <hi>Brugenſis,</hi> as he did againſt the other extreme of <hi>Scaligers Auguſtin</hi> thus: <hi>Non de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bemus intelligere coenam factam, veluti jam conſummatam atque tranſactam: adhuc enim
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:47497:158"/>coenabatur, cum Dominus ſurrexit, &amp; pedes lavit diſcipulis. Nam postea recubuit: &amp; buccellam ſuo traditori poſtea dedit, utique coenâ nondum finitâ (i) dum panis adhuc eſſet, in menſa.</hi> Wee muſt not conceive, <hi>After Supper</hi> (to be ſpoken) as if Supper had beene then conſummated, and perfectly finiſhed: for as yet they were at Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, when the Lord aroſe, and waſhed his Diſciples feete. For afterwards he ſate downe againe, and afterwards gave the Sop to him that ſhould betray him; Supper being not yet fully finiſhed: (that is to ſay) while bread was yet upon the Table.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Beza</hi> was more judicious in this poynt, ſaying of <hi>Chriſt, a menſâ conſurgens, &amp; pedibus diſcipulorum in medio convivio, contra quotidianum morem, ablutis rurſum diſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buit:</hi> agreeing with, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.4. and 12. <hi>verſes.</hi> It was towards the midſt of the ſecond ſupper, when <hi>Chriſt</hi> aroſe to waſh his Diſciples feete, and after his ſecond ſitting he did eate againe. Yet <hi>Beza</hi> ſeemeth much miſtaken; ſaying, that the chiefe of the family keept ſome of the unleavened bread, hid under a Napkin till the end of feaſt: which feaſt being done, he drew out from under the Napkin; the other part of the bread, broken into ſo many peices, as there were fellow-feeders, or friendly gueſts; and he firſt tooke part, and gave the reſt to his companions, with this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. <hi>This is the bread of affliction, which our Fathers did eate in Aegypt;</hi> for this Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction was at the beginning of Supper, before the Maſter of the houſe had dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the ſop in the platter, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> well obſerveth; and it ſtandeth with all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, that they ſhould be inſtructed thus, before they did eate, rather than af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That he brings an authority from the Rituall of the <hi>Jewes; viz.</hi> That every other night they did eate of herbs of all ſorts, but in the Rite of the paſſeover, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>ex intybis;</hi> and yet <hi>Scaliger</hi> confeſſeth, that the ſauce, into which both the unleave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned bread, and the ſoure herbes were dipped; was, <hi>Satura olerum amarorum, quae aliis ejuſmodi ſpiſſabatur,</hi> was full of bitter herbes, and thickned with other herbes of the like kinde. Here are more herbs than the Rituall alloweth.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. That he maketh the ſecond Supper to be incontinently, and immediatly after the firſt: when of neceſſitie, we muſt grant a time for the adminiſtrants, or ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours to bring up, and hanſomely, and orderly, to place on the boord, the diverſly-dreſſed fleſh of the Herd; though the paſchall Lambe was not wholly conſumed, but yet ſtood on the Table, whilſt the heavenly Table-talke continued: and though the Table-cloth was not wholly, or fully removed, but rather cleanſed.</p>

And in Generall I ſay, They fell to their ſecond Supper, and continued at it about a quarter of an houre, in all likelihood. Then Chriſt riſeth from this ſecond Supper, though they continued ſtill at Supper, and was about one quarter of an houre more wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing the feet of all the 12. Apoſtles, and putting off, and putting on his garments as may be well conjectured at, by the proportion of time to the things done, and ſayd. Thirdly, when Chriſt was ſet downe againe, hee began his diſcourſes, deſignes out the Traitour: gives him a ſop: biddeth him doe quickly what hee did: and upon the receiving of the ſop, <hi>Iudas</hi> immediately went out: and theſe things tooke up the laſt part of the houre, or ſomewhat more; and in, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that time they may well ſeeme to be accompliſhed and tranſacted.</p>
                        <p>And ſo the firſt and ſecond Supper, tooke up one whole, houre, or about one quarter more rather. More particularly, concerning the firſt of the three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſpent in the ſecond Supper, this ſeemeth to mee moſt probable.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Scaliger</hi> citeth the Jewiſh Rituall thus, concerning the Paſchall. <hi>Quam di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſahaec nox à caeter is noctibus? In aliis noctibus ſemel tantum lavamus: in hac no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cte bis.</hi> How divers was this night from other nights? In other nights we waſh but onely once, in this night twice: and this was at the beginning of their ſecond ſupper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet they did not breake the Law: for Gods Law eſtabliſhed no ſuch ſecond double waſhing: but it was a cuſtome and tradition of the Elders, to which Chriſt was not bound. And wëe find no ſhadow of a ſecond waſhing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the beginning of the ſecond ſupper: but rather about the midd'ſt of it, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther toward the end of it.

<pb n="281" facs="tcp:47497:161"/>giving to God, and bleſſing of the meate of the <hi>Chagigah</hi> which was newly ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in: for this was farre a more neceſſary duty: and was as frequently uſed by all good people, as it was neceſſary.

                        <p>BEfore the eating of Manna the grace is thought to be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this. <hi>Benedictus es (Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus Deus noſter, Rex Angelorum, Pater Coeli) qui cibaſti nos pane coeleſti An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelorum.</hi> Bleſſed be thou (O Lord our God,) King of the Angels, Father of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, who haſt fed us with the heavenly food of Angels.

This was the ordinary bleſſing of bread, which was commonly uſed after the Jewes came to <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> and perhaps in Chriſts time.

And now ſuppoſe that three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſuch ſingle Grapes, grew upon one branch, may it not be carried betweene two, upon one colt-ſtaffe? So much on the by, to explaine a ſeeming difficulty of Scripture; and yet I opine that the meſſengers did carry on the barre between them ſome Pomegranates, and Figges alſo, as is in the ſame verſe, which might be ſo many, as to make a juſt and portable ſhoulder-burthen.</p>

                        <p>THey gave thankes; they dranke wine, they did eate; they diſcourſed: and all this was done in the firſt quarter of an houre in the ſecond Supper. But what was their diſcourſe? Or why did <hi>Chriſt</hi> take occaſion to waſh their feete? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, we can know neither of theſe things infallibly, and demonſtratively.

                        <p>Before I come to demonſtration, I muſt proceede upon three foundations probable enough.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, that the Apoſtles might fall out, or ſtrive upon ſeverall occaſions, though none be expreſſely mentioned. Seven gueſts make a feaſt; but nine feaſters make a brawle, or are ſcandalous, ſaith the old proverbe. Many harmeleſſe occurrences might engender debate.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, that there was controverſie betweene them, now eſpecially in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſecond Supper, about ſuperioritie is moſt probable.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div n="6" type="paragraph">
                        <head>PAR. 6.</head>
                        <p>THirdly, that S. <hi>Luke</hi> toucheth at their contention, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.24. I hold very likely. For though he placeth the contention after the third Supper, according to the literall Method; yet in the order of Hiſtory it is to be taken in at the ſecond Supper. And behold the ground of my conjecture.</p>
                        <p>It is ſcarce credible that preſently after the devour receiving of the moſt holy Euchariſt, there ſhould be diſſention for Primacy. I dare ſay, who had ſuch pridy,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:47497:163"/>ambitious thoughts, preſently upon the new Sacrament, they had beene unworthy receivers thereof: which none of the Apoſtles were; for <hi>Iudas</hi> received not: of which hereafter.</p>
                        <p>Againe, it is ſaid, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.21. <hi>But behold the hand of him that betrayeth me, is with me on the table.</hi> Now theſe words are ſpoken after the adminiſtration of the bleſſed Euchariſt, what followes thence? Either we muſt make <hi>Iudas</hi> a participant of the body &amp; bloud of <hi>Chriſt</hi> (which though ſome have held, more have held otherwiſe, &amp; that with greater reaſon) &amp; we muſt make, that after the third Supper, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued eating, the Table being yet ſpread, and meat thereon: (for elſe, why was the hand of <hi>Iudas</hi> with <hi>Chriſt</hi> on the Table?) and ſo in effect we muſt make a fourth Supper of <hi>Christ;</hi> the Paſſeover; the common ſecond Supper, the moſt bleſſed Euchariſt; and laſtly, this <hi>Poſt-coenium,</hi> or Reere-Supper, which is moſt falſe and vaſt. Or elſe, we muſt grant, that the holy Spirit did not ſtand ſo ſtrictly, upon the literall method in S. <hi>Luke,</hi> which is moſt true; as I touched at before; and may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare yet farther, becauſe almoſt the ſame words, are deſcribed by S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and S. <hi>Marke,</hi> Before <hi>Chriſt</hi> adminiſtred his moſt holy Supper, which S. <hi>Luke</hi> placeth after the third and moſt ſacred Supper.</p>
                        <p>Therefore I ſay, Their contention was before their being ſatisfied in the point controverted; and their ſatisfaction was before the receiving of the moſt bleſſed Euchariſt; and the meanes to ſatisfie them, was <hi>Chriſts</hi> moſt extraordinary humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And now by theſe ſteppes of conjecture, and probability, I am come to the more certaine obſervations.</p>
                        <p>That the Apoſtles often fell out among themſelves, ſtriving for ſuperioritie, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied. S. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelfe, was in a manner over-curiouſly jealous of the company of S. <hi>Iohn, What ſhall this man doe? Ioh.</hi> 21.21. And <hi>Chriſt</hi> beat off S. <hi>Peter,</hi> thus, <hi>If I will that be tarry till I come, what is that to thee?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The tenne Apoſtles were moved with indignation againſt the two brethren of <hi>Zebedees</hi> children, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.24. becauſe one would have a promiſe to be on the right hand of <hi>Christ;</hi> and the other on the left. And <hi>Chriſt</hi> tooke the Apoſtles off from their paſſion, ſaying, <hi>Whoſoever will be great among you, let him be your Miniſter, and whoſoever will he chiefe among you, let him be your ſervant: as the Sonne of man came not to be miniſtred unto, but to minister, Matth.</hi> 20.26, 27, <hi>&amp;</hi> 28. <hi>verſes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>By the way they diſputed among themſelves, who ſhould be greateſt, <hi>Marke</hi> 9.34. but he told the twelve. <hi>If any man deſire to be firſt, the ſame ſhall be laſt of all, and ſervant of all, verſe</hi> 35. A primacy he denieth not among them, it was, and is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie; but the affectation, and ambition of it, he diſliketh, and ſets them point blanke on the contrary.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Luke</hi> 9.46. <hi>There aroſe a reaſoning among them, viz. the twelve Apoſtles, which of them ſhould be the greateſt? And Jeſus perceiving the thoughts of their heart, tooke a child, and ſet him by him, verſe</hi> 47. <hi>ſet him in the midſt of them, and tooke him in his armes, Marke</hi> 9.36. <hi>and ſaid to his Apostles; Except ye be converted, and become as little children, yee ſhall not enter into the kingdome of heaven: and whoſoever ſhall humble himſelfe as this little child, the ſame is greateſt in the kingdome of heaven. Matth.</hi> 18.3. <hi>and</hi> 4. <hi>verſes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It was one thought of many men: one heart of twelve Apoſtles; the thought of theïr heart; all thought ſo, every one deſired it: and every one was anſwered.</p>
                        <p>When all theſe moſt divine actions, words, and counſells were either forgotten or neglected: and after the Paſſeover, and at the ſecond Supper. There was a ſtrife among them, which of them ſhould be accounted the greateſt, <hi>Luk</hi> 22.24. Chriſt anſwereth in words, from <hi>verſ.</hi> 25. to <hi>verſ.</hi> 30. <hi>incluſivè.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And when thoſe words had not wrought fully enough on them nor humbled them ſufficiently. Then, and upon this occaſion (as I judge) Chriſt anſwered them indeede, and went a quicker and more piercing way, to teach them humilitie, knowing their contention came not from God: knowing he came from God, and went to God; <hi>Chriſt riſeth from Supper, and laid aſide his garments, and tooke a towell, and girded himſelfe, powreth water into a Baſon, Joh.</hi> 13.4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>But <hi>Oſiander</hi> was mad to ſay, <hi>Chriſt</hi> waſhed their feete before the eating of the Paſchall, we have proved, <hi>Chriſt</hi> waſhed them in the ſecond Supper. There is not ſo much as a ſhadow of likelihood, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> waſhed the Apoſtles feete, before the Paſchall: and in the ſecond Supper alſo.</p>
                        <p>S. <hi>Cyrill</hi> in his Booke, <hi>De Ablutione pedum,</hi> is in another extreme; That our Saviour waſhed his Diſciples, after the receiving of the Euchariſt.

The truth is, the <hi>Iewes</hi> of thoſe times, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan their ſecond waſhing, at the beginning of their ſecond Supper: but <hi>Chriſt</hi> did ſo in the middle of the ſecond Supper, or rather toward the beginning of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt preparing his Apoſtles to a worthy receiving, both by waſhing them, and giving them good advice; and I hold his Concluſion to be good, who ſaid, <hi>Cum loti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>
                           <hi>Baronius</hi> hath a good argument againſt the innovating <hi>Oſiander,</hi> That the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall Lambe being to be eaten in haſte if <hi>Chriſt</hi> had riſen from it, and waſhed their feete, before the end of that Supper, he had broken the Law; but he brake not the Law. Therefore it was at the ſecond Supper; even toward the latter end thereof, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> by his owne waſhing of them, prapared them by humility unto the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of his owne laſt, beſt, and bleſſed Euchariſt, being truely called the Supper of the Lord.</p>
                        <p>If I have not gueſſed rightly, at the true cauſe, and juſt occaſion, why <hi>Chriſt</hi> waſhed his Apoſtles feete; yet it is moſt certaine, that he waſhed them; which, as I ſaid, tooke up about another quarter of an houre of their ſecond Supper.</p>
                        <p>No man can reaſonably thinke, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> did waſh their feete at the Paſſeover; that was ſoone ended, as the waſhing and wiping was ended. Nor may it be thought that <hi>Chriſt</hi> would riſe from the moſt ſacred Supper of the Euchariſt, to waſh them. This derogateth too much from that divine Supper. Therefore the ſecond Supper was the fitteſt time; and in it, indeede did <hi>Chriſt</hi> waſh them: For, how could he waſh the feete of twelve of them ſeverally, twenty foure feete in all, as they continued at Supper, in leſſe time, then a quarter of an houre? and wipe them all (and well wiped them out of queſtion) with that towell wherewith he was

                        <p>A little before Chriſts incarnation there was a booke written by the Scribes, in which they commanded frequent waſhings, even in the times of dinner or ſupper, becauſe there were many Legall uncleanneſſes, which came by the very touch of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers things: and by which they were uncleane till the Evening. Therefore had they ſtore of water alwayes in a readineſſe. At the Marriage in <hi>Cana, Iohn</hi> 2.6. <hi>There were ſet ſixe water-pots of ſtone, after the manner of the purifying of the Iewes:</hi> Sc. <hi>aut legalem, aut traditionalem, aut convivalem,</hi> either Legall, or traditionall or convivall <hi>Each water Pot containing two or three firkins a peece, non ad potum ſed ad lotionem paratae aequales illae hydriae, aut vaſa aquaria.</hi> Thoſe water-pots were not prepared, for drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king but for waſhing. And in likelihood they had ſpent ſome good quantity of that water. For Chriſt commanded them to <hi>fill them: and they filled them up to the brimme, verſ.</hi> 7. And againſt the Paſſeover, our Saviour did foretell them they ſhould meete a man <hi>bearing a pitcher of water, Mark.</hi> 14.13. And when it is ſayd, <hi>He ſhall ſhew you a roome furniſhed:</hi> among other things it may well be expounded: <hi>A roome furniſhed with ſtore of water;</hi> for they had water alwayes in a readineſſe for purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions preſcribed by the Elders, as well as for legall purifications.</p>

                           <hi>Ciacconius</hi> is of opinion, that water was given for their feete at the entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the houſes, yet it was to ſuch, as were ſoule and uncleane: for if they were cleane they preſently ſate downe, ſaith he. But <hi>Baronius</hi> from the Rituall ſaith; the <hi>Jewes</hi> waſhed their feete twice at the Paſchall Lan be: once at the eating of the fleſh, and once at the eating of unleavened bread. Either the Rituall, or <hi>Baronius</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundeth matters: for they are not Paſchall Lambe, but with unleavened bread firſt taken. <hi>Baronius</hi> ſhould rather have diſtinguiſhed two ſuppers, <hi>Legalem, &amp; commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi> the Paſchall and Common Supper, then make one Supper of the Lambe, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of unleavened bread, as he doth in the words following: <hi>Paſchalis Convivii duplexfuit Caena conjuncta: vel ſi dicere velimus, unius coenae duplex menſa: in cujus priori, eſus agni, in poſteriori vero ceremonia agebatur azymorum.</hi> There was a two-fold joynt ſupper of the Paſchall banquet: or if we may ſo ſpeake, two courſes at the ſame Supper: In the former was the Paſchall Lambe eaten; in the latter was the Ceremonie of unleavened bread performed. Yet indeede neither was ſet on the board or table without the other, and they are not the fleſh of the Lambe without unleavened bread. Now though this was a tradition of the <hi>Iewes</hi> often, yet this was their owne <hi>Sumpſimus:</hi> and Chriſt did not waſh the Apoſtles feete, for the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, that the <hi>Iewes</hi> waſhed themſelves; but to give a good example of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>

                        <p>AFter Chriſt reaſoneth thus, both from the matter it ſelfe, and from their owne confeſſions, <hi>If I then your Lord, and Maſter have waſhed your feete, ye ought to waſh one anothers feete; Ioh.</hi> 13.14. And by the waſhing of feete, he meaneth not onely the bodily waſhing, literally; but rather the exceeding humbleneſſe of mind, and the double diligence, which we are to exhibite unto our brethren for their good. Every ſuperiour muſt have his heart ſo prepared, that though he command others outwardly, he may deſerve to himſelfe inwardly ſuch Chriſtian humiliation, that he preferreth the very inferior, whom he commandeth, before himſelfe; and grudge not any ſervill-ſeeming, baſe worke to ſave the ſoule of a ſinner.

Again, <hi>in Canonibus, titulo de conſecratione. diſtinctione.</hi> 2. <hi>C. cum omne; Iulius</hi> both refuteth, and abrogateth that cuſtome of giving to the people the Euchariſt dipped, becauſe Chriſt gave to none of his Apoſtles ſuch an endippid bit, but to <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> onely; which ſoked morſell ſhould be, as an infallible token; to ſigne out the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayer of his Maſter: not a ſigne of the inſtitution of the Sacrament.</p>

But S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> is much miſtaken in thinking, that before this Sop given, <hi>Iudas,</hi> and all the Apoſtles had received from Chriſt the Sacrament of his body and blood. And though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; he embraceth not the method of S. <hi>Luke,</hi> yet here he ſtands too ſtrict upon it; and makes a kind of Supper after the bleſſed Sacrament, which hath its incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, great and unſufferable; of which, <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>I Winde up all. Suppoſe we, that this Morſell was Bread, that this bread was dipped in wine; yet was it not the conſecrated, either bread, or wine, but part of the ſecond Supper. S. <hi>Bernard, in Sermone.</hi> 3. <hi>de Coena Domini, Columella.</hi> 1355. is expreſſe. That the Sacrament was not given <hi>Tune,</hi> by the ſoppe; <hi>Chriſtus buccellam ſolummodò intinctam, non conſecratam Judae porrexit,</hi> ſaith <hi>Ludolphus Carthuſianus, parte,</hi> 2 <hi>cap.</hi> 55. Chriſt gave <hi>Iudas</hi> onely a dipped, not a conſecrated ſoppe.</p>
                        <p>The reaſon of <hi>Soto</hi> is good. When Chriſt gave to the reſt of his Diſciples ſeveral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his body; and his blood after, <hi>ſub forma Potûs;</hi> under the forme of wine; wee may not thinke he gave it to <hi>Iudas,</hi> dipped, or ſoked; for this is not to eate and drinke. Therefore the ſame <hi>Soto</hi> in the ſame place, <hi>viz.</hi> 4. <hi>Sentent, Diſtinct.</hi> 12. <hi>Quaeſt.</hi> 2. <hi>Artic.</hi> 2. thus, <hi>Hillarius &amp; univerſi; Hillary,</hi> and all the reſt of the Fathers with S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> agree, that in, or with that ſoppe, <hi>Iudas</hi> tooke not the body, and blood of Chriſt. And no man can diſſent from this, ſaith he. Yet I diſſent from, <hi>Soto,</hi> when he is peremptory, that the <hi>buccella,</hi> or morſell was <hi>intincta in vino,</hi> dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in wine; for <hi>Salſamentum,</hi> was not neceſſary, ſaith he, to the eating of the Lambe. Firſt, he is much miſtaken in the word <hi>Salſamentum,</hi> which (I opine) he taketh for ſauce, when it ſignifieth any ſalted thing; fiſh, fleſh, or other ſalt <hi>Edulia,</hi> or victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls; or muſt it needes be dipped in wine, becauſe there was no <hi>Salſamentum,</hi> or ſauce? I am ſure there is no ſalt in that inference.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, they had ſoure herbs, and their juyce (ſaith the <hi>Rituall</hi>) at the eating of the Paſchall. Thirdly, this Inſtitution was after the Paſchall Supper. But ſaith he, Chriſt cared not for delicates. True; but firſt, who ſaith, Chriſt tooke any of that ſoppe? Secondly, who granteth the <hi>Embamma,</hi> or ſauce to be delicate? Wine was more delicate then it. It is not likely that it was dipped in water, ſaith he.
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:47497:171"/>True; How followeth it, that it was dipped in wine? They had (ſaith he) both conſecrated, and unconſecrated wine. I doubt not but in this Second Supper, they had <hi>Eſculenta, poculenta, condimenta.</hi> Meates, drinkes, and ſauces, of great variety.</p>
                        <q>
                           <l>At the Paſcall they had wine, as I proved fully before.</l>
                           <l>At the ſecond Supper, ſaith the <hi>Kituall</hi> they had wine.</l>
                           <l>At the ſacred Euchariſt they had wine.</l>
                        </q>
                        <p>Yet that the ſoppe given to <hi>Iudas,</hi> was dipped in wine, cannot be proved, or probabilized. <hi>In Evangelio nihil habetur,</hi> the Goſpell doth not at all ſpecialize, (ſaith <hi>Soto</hi> himſelfe) into what it was dipped. Conjecture therefore had beene fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the poſitive anſwer, That it was dipped in wine.</p>

                        <p>Authorities to prove that <hi>Iudas</hi> did.

                        <p>FOurthly, none of the Diſciples, knew the ſecret ſinne of <hi>Iudas,</hi> ſo he was not deprived of the ſacred Euchariſt, for this cauſe.

If not, yet Chriſt knew him to be uncleane, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.10. and 11. verſ. and knew him to be a Devill. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.70. and 71. verſ. Therefore though Chriſt admitted <hi>Iudas</hi> into his company; and to the dying tranſient Paſſeover, and to the ſecond Supper, though he waſhed and wiped his feete; yet it ſtandeth with no likelihood, that our holy Saviour, would admit ſo ſinfull a ſoule, to ſo heavenly a banquet. If in defence of the Prime part of this objection it be ſayd, that no man at the table knew for what intent Chriſt ſayd unto him, <hi>That thou doeſt doe quickely, Iohn</hi> 13.28. Till I come pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely to handle the point, let this anſwere ſerve; All the Apoſtles might both know the traytour expreſly, and yet be ignorant, what was the meaning of thoſe words of Chriſt, for they little imagined, that <hi>Iudas</hi> would have betrayed Chriſt ſo ſoone, even that night, and they did then little imagine, that then Chriſt gave the Devill full power over him.</p>

                        <p>FIfthly, Chriſt admitted <hi>Iudas</hi> to the Paſchall, and to the Common Supper; then why was he not admitted to the Holy Euchariſt? I anſwere, favour hath its latitude: even among us, we admit ſome, and not others, into our companie; and among them, ſome into our friendſhip, others into familiarity: to ſome wee ſhew curreſies ina meane degree, to other in an higher degree. <hi>Iudas</hi> was choſen as well as the reſt to be an Apoſtle. <hi>I know whom I have choſen,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.18. But he is named in the laſt place, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.4. And though he carried the bagge, and kept the money, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.29. I account that was no favour unto him. It was not in it ſelfe, but to his courtuous ſoule as a ſnare, and ſtumbling-block. Nor doe you ever finde any ſteps of extraordinary favour of Chriſt unto him. He ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled out ſometimes two, and ſometimes three, unto eſpeciall Services, and to bee perſonall beholders, of his more ſecret, and Divine affaires. <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> were ſent by Chriſt to prepare the Paſſeover, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.8. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> waited on him, <hi>John</hi> 21.20.

Leſt after the receiving of that ſaving Sacrament, the Devill To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, enter into him, as he did into <hi>Iudas.</hi> But how can it be Together and yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Sacrament: neither is the word Together, in the Liturgie, and therefore he did ill to put in the word <hi>ſimul;</hi> by which his opinion is diſcerned, that he thought <hi>Iudas</hi> received the bleſſed Euchariſt, and with it the Devill.</p>
                        <p>I anſwere, the words, <hi>As he entredinto Iudas,</hi> make not, and evince not a perfect ſimilitude in every particular, extending to the very circumſtances of time, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning our, at what Supper, this was ſayd, or done, or when the Devill firſt entred into <hi>Iudas.</hi> For the holy compilers of our Liturgie, could not be ignorant, both that <hi>Iudas</hi> entertained, and hugg'd the pretended treaſon, before he came to Supper; <hi>Mark.</hi> 14.10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 11. <hi>verſ.</hi> And S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaketh as of a thing paſſed, even before or at the beginning of the ſecond Supper, <hi>Iob.</hi> 13.2. The Devill having now put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heart of <hi>Iudas Iſcariot</hi> to betray Chriſt; which word (now) is not to be taken excluſively, as if it were not in his heart before, or elſe after, for even before the Paſſeover, <hi>Satan entred into Iudas,</hi> compare <hi>Luke</hi> 22.3. and 7. And before men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the conſecrated bread and wine: the Devill entreth into ſinfull men, who have no touch of Repentance. Let others ſay or thinke what they will, I will not lay an aſperſion of neſciencie, in ſo high a degree, as to ſay or thinke; that thoſe holy fathers and framers of our Liturgie, did imagine, that the Sop was the Sacrament, or that Satan entred not into <hi>Iudas</hi> till he had taken the Sop, and did enter after hee had received the bleſſed Sacrament, which points may ſeeme to reſult from the Lyturgie, if the words bee throughly ſtretched and tentred.</p>
                        <p>Againe, I ſuppoſe that the Liturgicall exhortation, is to be taken <hi>in ſenſu diviſo, non in ſenſu compoſito; attingens rem ipſam, non expreſſe ſignans, aut comparans moment<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <item>Secondly, that any man continuing in any mortall ſinne, eateth and drinketh his owne damnation.</item>
                           <item>Thirdly, that a preparatory clenſing is neceſſary, ere a man receive. For the ſoule of the compariſon conſiſteth in this; that wicked men, in <hi>flagrantiâ delictorum,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming to receive, whilſt they lye or ſit on the dregges of their ſinnes, ſhall be plagued and puniſhed, as <hi>Iudas</hi> was both in body and ſoule; by the entrance of the Devill into them.</item>
                           <item>Fourthly, and laſtly; that this is to be feared and may come to paſſe, in the time after the bleſſed Sacrament, taken by unfaithfull, and uncharitable Chriſtians. This is ſufficient to be beleeved; this is ſufficient to prepare, warne; admoniſh and terrifie the wicked; this is ſufficient to be practiſed. For God puniſheth not, before the ſinne committed: yea ſeldome doth God puniſh, but he giveth a ſpace to repent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the ſinne and the puniſhment.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>But in my opinion, the Lyturgie never intended to define the time, when the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill entred into <hi>Judas,</hi> (which was more than once, as I proved before) and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expreſſed nor meant, that the time of the Devills entring into <hi>Iudas:</hi> and the time of his threatned entring into hardned Chriſtians, were juſt, and exactly the ſame time, namely, after the receiving of the bleſſed Sacrament. For the Sop was not the Sacrament, and immediately after it, the devill went in, and <hi>Iudas</hi> went out.</p>

<pb n="341" facs="tcp:47497:175"/>quoque</hi> Iudam <hi>in poteſtatem Diaboli:</hi> the Ancients doe note, that the Lord by that ſop, did cut off, ſeparate, and divide <hi>Iudas,</hi> from the holy Quire (of the Apoſtles) and did deliver him over into the power of the devill. This proveth, that <hi>Iudas</hi> went out, before the holy Sacrament was adminiſtred. And how could he then partake of the Euchariſt?</p>
                        <p>Moreover the words <hi>(As he entred into Iudas)</hi> may be as a parentheſis, having an entire ſenſe of it ſelfe, though the word of ſimilitude reacheth not to identifie the times; but onely compareth the entrances themſelves: and the words are full of Divine ſenſe, though they were reade; <hi>Come not to this holy Table, leſt after the taking of that holy Sacrament, the Devill enter into you; and fill you full of all iniquities.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Moreover the Lyturgie may truely be ſayd, to compare the ſinnes, and following puniſhments; though it compared not the times; who offend like <hi>Iudas,</hi> ſhall be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed like <hi>Iudas,</hi> though the Devill entred into <hi>Iudas,</hi> even before the Paſchall Supper: and doth enter into Chriſtians, after they have received: the puniſhment ſhall be all one, though inflicted at ſeverall times.</p>
                        <p>Before the Paſſeover <hi>Iudas</hi> ſought how he might conveniently betray him: <hi>Mark.</hi> 14.11. <hi>And before the Paſſeover Iudas ſought opportunity to betray him, Mat.</hi> 26.16. Yea before he trafficked for blood; and before he communed with the chiefe Prieſts, and Captaines, Satan entred into <hi>Iudas, Luk.</hi> 22.3. For he had reſolved for the ſinne before, and then Satan entred. He entred alſo into him after hee had received the ſop: and this was at the ſecond Supper. Which of thoſe two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames did the Lyturgie intimate?</p>
                        <p>Againe, when Satan entred into <hi>Iudas,</hi> is no matter of faith: or of any great conſequence; nor is ſo propounded to us in the Lyturgie.</p>
                        <p>Laſt of all, the Lyturgie doth not ſay, that <hi>Iudas</hi> received the Divine food, of the moſt Sacred Euchariſt, nor can the ſenſe of thoſe words be deduced thence. But it ſaith at the utmoſt extenſion, that the devill entred into <hi>Iudas,</hi> after he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the holy Sacrament. Which holy Sacrament may very well be underſtood of the Paſſeover; which was an holy Sacrament of the <hi>Iewes:</hi> and which <hi>Iudas</hi> que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſſe did take; and after which he tooke the Sop, at the ſecond Supper, and then the devill entred into him. And yet for all this, <hi>Iudas</hi> did not partake of the body and blood of our Lord, which he was juſtly ſeparated from, becauſe he had ſinned, and betrayed the innocent blood, as himſelfe confeſſed of himſelfe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.4. And this I hold to be the moſt ſatisfactory anſwere, to that ſpecious obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, from the Lyturgie: the word Sacrament being applyable both to the Jewiſh and Chriſtian Sacrament: <hi>Judas</hi> taking the former, the other Diſciples taking both.</p>

                        <p>The ſame <hi>Ludolphus, cap.</hi> 55. Satan entreth into mans body eſſentially, as in the poſſeſſed with devills; God alone entreth into the ſoule; and eſſentially getteth into the minde; for the ſoule hath no dimenſions of quantitie, that any thing can be ſaid to be in it, as contained within thoſe dimenſions; and ſo nothing can be in it, but that which gives it his being; and that is there by its vertue: but where Gods vertue is, there is his Eſſence: both of them are all one in him; therefore God alone is eſſentially in the ſoule; for he alone filleth the nature, or ſubſtance, by him cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated: yet Satan is ſaid to creepe into mens minds, <hi>per affectum, &amp; effectum malitie;</hi> by affecting of malice, and by effecting of it; in as much as man is ſeduced by him, and proceedeth to commit the evill which Satan ſuggeſteth.</p>

I anſwer, it ſeemeth to me, Satan poſſeſſed his very body, and that fully after the Sop; and that Satan hurried him at his pleaſure: he was led captive according to Satans owne will. I doubt not, but Satan did ſtrengthen the old ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions; and withall put freſh, and new temptations into his ſoule, for he cauſed him to hang himſelfe. But (ſaith <hi>Tolet</hi>) <hi>Iudas</hi> taking high diſpleaſure to be revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to be the Traytor, he opened his whole heart to Satan, and Satan entred into him, taking a firme and quiet poſſeſſion of him. For man ſinneth more licentiouſly, when he knoweth, that the ſinne which he committed ſecretly, is knowne pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely: <hi>Per ſcelera ſimper ſceleribus tutum eſt iter,</hi> ſaid a wicked one: Sinne once knowne is made more ſinfull.</p>

                        <p>LEt me inſert a little ragge of a Sermon, which I made before the moſt learned, and holy Prelate, our right reverend <hi>Diocoeſan,</hi> now Lord Biſhop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> concerning theſe temptations.</p>
                        <p>I take three Concluſions as granted;</p>
                        <p>The firſt Concluſion preſuppoſed, as a knowne truth, is, That the temptations of the world, are ſometimes ſeverall temptations, from thoſe of Satan. If God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held Satan from tempting of a man; yet muſt we be alſo unſpotted of the world, <hi>Iames</hi> 1.27. For there are pollutions of the world, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Beware of men</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.17. well expounded by S. <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Beware of evill workers.</hi> Laſtly, the ranking of our enemies, under the diſtinct Enſignes of the Fleſh, the World, and the Devill ſhewes there are divers, and divided temptations.</p>
                        <q xml:lang="lat">Sunt trio qua tentant hominem, mundus, Caro, Daemon,</q>
                        <q>
                           <l>Three things there are which doe tempt man,</l>
                           <l>The world, the fleſh, and old Satan.</l>
                        </q>
                        <p>This proves the ſecond truth alſo, which I aſſumed as granted; That the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the fleſh, are oftentimes ſeverall from the aſſaults of the devill. If there were no devill at all (ſaith <hi>Origen</hi>) <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>ſecundo;</hi> we yet ſhould finde
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:47497:179"/>unlawfull deſires, and appetites; <hi>The fleſh would luſt againſt the ſpirit, Iames</hi> 4.1. <hi>Warres and fightings come even of your luſts, that warre in your members:</hi> warres upon warres; and <hi>Iames</hi> 1.14. <hi>Every man is tempted, when hee is drawne away of his owne luſts and intiſed;</hi> which temptation, is there declared, by theſe three degrees; the Beginning, the Procedure, and the Conſummation. Or thus; the Primitive Motion, the Aſſiſting Commotion (<hi>Mota facilius commoventur</hi>) when things are once moved, they move the faſter.) The Plenary agreeing, begetting death. S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> varieth the phraſes, though not the ſenſe, <hi>de Geneſ. contra manicheos,</hi> 2.14. that the temptation of the fleſh, is accompliſhed, by Suggeſtion, Delight, and Pleaſure.</p>
                        <p>The third Concluſion preſumed, as undeniable, is this; The devill may be ſaid, to be author, and cauſe of all, and every temptation, nor directly, but indirectly, not alwayes immediatly, but principally, and occaſionally; Since wee have never knowne, the luſts of the fleſh; or the baytes of the world, if hee had not beene. I am loth to goe ſo farre as <hi>Hierom,</hi> on that of the <hi>Pſalmograph, Eſchew evill, and doe good;</hi> who ſaith; <hi>Omnia mala ab inſtinctu diaboli procedunt; ſicut bona ab inſtinctu Dei;</hi> All evill proceedes from the inſtinct of the devill as all good from the inſpiration of God; for from God flow all graces directly: yet Satan, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>: moſt properly is called the Tempter, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. and is meant, where it is ſaid; <hi>Leſt the Tempertempt you,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.5. He begat in mankinde, a diſpoſition to ſinne, as a Cleaver of wood prepareth it for burning. He miniſtreth preſent matter, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curreth in moſt temptations, as the Fueller layeth ſticks upon the fire, and bloweth the coales, uſing both the World, and the Fleſh, as his inſtruments, to ſet us, <hi>in Comburo</hi> (as the <hi>Spaniard</hi> phrazeth it) and to ſeduce us. In which regard, when we overcome the World, or the Fleſh, we may be ſaid in a ſort to reſiſt the devill; and yet he hath peculiar Temptations, by us to be oppoſed, <hi>Reſiſt the devill, and he will flie from you.</hi> So much for the three Concluſions.</p>

                        <p>THe Queſtion is, How ſhall we know the Temptations of the Devill, from the temptations of the World, and the Fleſh? Some thinke they cannot be knowne. I never read them diſtinguiſhed aptly enough.</p>
                        <p>I wiſh men would rather labour to avoyde all: yet I anſwer; The <hi>Obrepentes,</hi> or creeping Temptations, are more ſlow; The <hi>Aſcendentes,</hi> or ariſing Temptations more inward, and more naturall, yet more ſinfull; as Selfe-ſowne, Selfe-growne, in the corrupt maſſe of Mankinde. The third ſort are more quicke, more ſharpe, or leſſe thought of: and theſe proceede from Sathan more immediatly.</p>
                        <p>Once againe thus; The temptations of the World, properly are, when men and women are drawne unto ſinne, by other folkes flatterings, perſwaſions, threats, faſhions, evill examples, or cuſtomes of the world, becauſe of theſe ſcandalls. The temptations of the Fleſh, are not onely carnall luſts, but all inordinate concupiſcence of any wordly things. The Apoſtle reckoneth, even ſome ſpirituall offences among the ſinnes of the fleſh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19. For the concupiſcence, even of the Regenerate, hath its ſeate; not in the ſenſitive appetite, ſo much, as in the reaſonable ſoule.</p>

<pb n="349" facs="tcp:47497:179"/>or uſe our owne fleſh againſt us. Amongſt Temptations, thoſe are very greivous, and fiery, when <hi>internis oppugnans, de noſtro; contra nos roboratur;</hi> when Satan worketh with our luſts, is ſtrengthened by our owne corruption fighteth againſt us, with our owne weapons. But the moſt dangerous, and worſt temptation of all, is, when the world allureth; when the fleſh concurreth; when Satan ſpurreth on; and all three, <hi>Iunctis umbonibus factâ teſtudini;</hi> with might and mayne, fight againſt us; for the triple cord will ſcarce be broken: and he is a rare man, that can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland all three. Yet once more, the world tempteth outwardly, the fleſh inwardly, <hi>reſpectu fomitis,</hi> for <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.19. <hi>Out of the heart proceede</hi> (not onely) <hi>evill thoughts,</hi> but, <hi>falſe witneſſes, blaſphemies, and the defiling ſinfulneſſe of the mouth, yea thefts, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and other abominations.</hi> The workes of the hands; Satan tempteth, both inwardly, and outwardly; joyntly, and ſeverally; All is fiſh that comes to his net: the ſame ſin is <hi>Earthly</hi> (that is of the world) <hi>Senſuall</hi> (and that is of the fleſh;) <hi>Deviliſh</hi> (that is from Satan) <hi>James</hi> 3.15. I will not end this poynt yet.</p>

                        <p>THe creatures of God, (<hi>quatenus tales,</hi> as they are meere creatures) are good and tempt us not; yea cannot tempt us. If they be ſtumbling-blockes to the ſoules of men, and a ſnare-trappe or ſcandall; it is to the unwiſe, <hi>Wiſedome</hi> 14.11. God intendeth not primarily, it is by caſualtie, and the depravation of our nature: the ſtarres, and the coeleſtiall Influences, tempt no man to ſinne; if they worke on our bodily humors; and if man will be inclined (for his will cannot be forced; and the inclination may be bent contrarily) it is a branch of the fleſhly temptation; meate, drinke, beauty, ſilver, and gold, have not inwardly, nor outwardly, in their owne nature, any tempting quality; the immoderate deſire, or uſe, of theſe, are boughes growing from a fleſhly roote.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Actus activorum ſunt in diſpoſitione patientis;</hi> every thing is, as it is taken: If they were ſuch, we may chuſe, whither they ſhall worke upon us, to our hurt; we may uſe them without ſinne. A beaten ſouldier, an holy reſolved man will not ſtoope to ſuch lures. The continuall provocation; as well as the perſeverance, in any ſinne, hath his heat, or vigor, renewed fom Hell, or Satan. I conclude ſummarily; the ſudden, cunningeſt, fierceſt, ſtrongeſt, laſtingeſt temptations, are from Satan.</p>
                        <p>More concerning the temptations of Satan; <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his Sermon, <hi>de Zelo, &amp; livore,</hi> excellently handleth divers temptations. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his narration, on the 106. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> reckoneth up other ſorts: the firſt of Error; the ſecond of Difficulty, to overcome our luſts. The third of tedious Dulneſſe; all cannot be numbred in a ſmall time. He tempts us in our meate, drinke, ſleepe, in body, and ſoule; in our thoughts, words, and actions.</p>

And now it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to me, that Chriſt prophecied of <hi>Iudas,</hi> and the words were certainely exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified, and actuated by <hi>Iudas,</hi> or upon him, which Chriſt ſpake, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.43. <hi>&amp;c. When the uncleane ſpirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, ſeeking reſt and finding none: then he ſaith,</hi> I <hi>will returne into my houſe, from whence</hi> I <hi>came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty ſwept and garniſhed: then goeth he and taketh with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſeven other ſpirits more wicked than himſelfe, and they enter in and dwell there: and the laſt ſtare of that man is worſe than the beginning. Beza</hi> ſaith, that the laſt words ſeeme to him to be very obſcure: let us apply them to <hi>Iudas,</hi> and they are plaine enough: It is true that Chriſt <hi>verſ.</hi> 45. <hi>Even ſo ſhall it be alſo to this wicked generation,</hi> which Prophecie concerning the <hi>Iewes,</hi> or the ſinfull men of that generation, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth not <hi>Iudas,</hi> from being here fore-prophecyed of, but rather includeth him: Chriſt ſpeaketh principally of one man, <hi>When the uncleane ſpirit is gone out of a man: and the laſt ſtate of that man is worſe than the firſt:</hi> What particular man ſhould hee point at, if not at <hi>Iudas?</hi> though like unto <hi>Iudas;</hi> the Iewes of that generation were called the Synagogue of Satan, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.9.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Auguſtine Tractatu</hi> 62. <hi>in Iohannem.</hi> Thus, <hi>Intravit Satanas poſt buccellam in Traditorem, ut ſibi jam traditum plenius poſſideret: in quem prius intraverat, ut deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peret.</hi> Satan entred into the Traytor, after the Sop, that he might take more full poſſeſſion of him, that was now delivered unto him; into whom he had formerly entred, that he might deceive him. And againe, <hi>Intravit nunc Satanas in</hi> Iudam, <hi>non ad hoc, ut dienum tentaret, ſedut proprium poſſideret.</hi> Satan now entred into <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das;</hi> not that he might tempt him as a ſtranger, but to take poſſeſſion of him, as of his owne proper goods. He was as other people, poſſeſſed with, and by the evill Spirit.</p>
                        <p>I conclude, when Satan entred firſt into <hi>Iudas,</hi> he had a great hand upon him; and
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:47497:180"/>over-ruled him; yet Satans power was ſtinted and confined, and limited. At the ſecond entrance, <hi>Iudas</hi> was wholy given over to Satan, ſoule and body; <hi>traditus ei ut inemendabilis:</hi> he was delivered over unto him, as one paſt all hope of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſaith <hi>The ophylact, traditus ei, ut tortori, ut carnifici,</hi> ſay I; he was delivered o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver unto him, as to a tormentor, hangman, or Iaylor: nor did hee come out of him till he had brought <hi>Iudas</hi> to hang himſelfe; but hurried him (as a Coach is drawne by wild horſes) to the Gallowes, and to hell.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Iulius Firmicus</hi> 8.19. expreſſeth a Naturall death thus; <hi>ſua morte morietur:</hi> hee dyed a naturall death: and the violent and ſuddaine death, of the conſpirators a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Iulius Caeſar, Suetonius</hi> deſcribeth in the end of <hi>Iulius</hi> his life in this ſort. <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo eorum ſua morte defunctus est.</hi> None of them died a naturall death: among violent deaths, there are few ſo bad, and deſperate as the hanging of ones ſelfe. For in moſt other deprivations of life, either by ſword or poyſon, or drowning, or the like, many thoughts of repentance have interceded, and doubtleſſe many a ſinfull ſoule, hath beene truely ſorry and contrite, and reconciled to God after a fatall blow, or <hi>inter pontem &amp; fontem;</hi> betweene the bridge and the river, and the like; but he who hangeth himſelfe, is ſo ſuddenly ſtrangled, and his breath ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, that he cannot call upon God, after the deede done, and hath not time to have a repenting heart, but the end of his life is the beginning of his damnation, and is taken <hi>in flagrantia facti;</hi> in the height of his unrepentable ſinne, eſpecially if the knot hit right enough. Me thinkes I ſee <hi>Judas</hi> after the taking of the ſop, with hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low eyes, gaſtly countenance, trembling joynts, unſteady motions, overcome with covetouſneſſe, fleſhed with malice, cloathed with darkeneſſe, and led by the Prince of darkeneſſe, poſting to the houſe of the chiefe Prieſts, and of the Phariſees, and Captaine of the band, that he might and did betray his Lord and Maſter. So did that Monſter of men that <hi>Terrae odium;</hi> hatred of the world, walke forward, and backeward, from the feaſting to the Higſt Prieſts, and from them to the Garden.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Here you muſt except our bleſſed Saviour himſelfe, (who was more than meere man) for he knew for what intent he ſpake, you muſt alſo except <hi>Iudas,</hi> who knew our Saviours meaning, and his owne corrupt intendments: and therefore accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, he went out immediately; no man at the table knew, for <hi>Iudas</hi> was gone from the table; and as he was bidden did quickely goe forth: and ſo he muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. All the reſt of the Colledge of the Apoſtles were ignorant, what Chriſt did primarily and particularly meane under thoſe Generall words; <hi>That thou doeſt doe quickely.</hi> Some thinke that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> is alſo to be excepted, becauſe he knew the Traytor, by the anſwere of Chriſt, and the reall delivery of the Sop, according to the anſwere. <hi>Barradius</hi> buildes upon this, as the truer anſwere; that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> himſelfe, though he knew the Traytor, did little imagine that Chriſt did then voluntarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to dye: but the Traytor would have betrayed him, at ſome other time, and not ſo ſoone. At the firſt hearing of them, the Apoſtles thought, they were words ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of command (which they could not conceive) than words of permiſſion. The innocent and moſt holy ſoules of the Apoſtles, not knowing then the entrance of Satan into <hi>Iudas,</hi> did not thinke that <hi>Iudas</hi> ſhould fall ſo ſuddenly, from one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame to another. It ſeemes to me that after the giving of the Sop, and after Satans entrance into <hi>Iudas,</hi> Chriſt ſayd; <hi>That thou doeſt doe quickely:</hi> that <hi>Iudas</hi> received it, and receiving it ſwallowed it; for though it be not ſayd, that <hi>Iudas</hi> ate it, yet if we conſider Chriſt dipping it, we may well thinke, it was that <hi>Judas</hi> might eate it. <hi>After the Sop, Satan entred into him:</hi> the ſop found the firſt entrance, Satan the next, and that immediately after.</p>
                        <p>So all theſe things concurre in a very ſhort time.</p>

                        <p>In the ſecond Watch of the night (which he calleth <hi>Canticinium,</hi> which word is miſ-printed, or otherwiſe <hi>Selneccerus</hi> was very ignorant to uſe that word inſtead of <hi>Galli Cantus;</hi> or <hi>Gallicinium;</hi> or for <hi>Conticinium,</hi> which is the firſt part of the night; from the crowing of the Cocke, which he placeth in the ſecond part, or Watch in the night. <hi>Circiter mediam noctem, Galli primum cantum edunt;</hi> ſaith <hi>Barradius, Tom.</hi> 4. <hi>pag.</hi> 268.

                        <p>After eleven of the clocke, Chriſt was betrayed, and taken; S. <hi>Peter</hi> cut off the eare of <hi>Malchus;</hi> the Diſciples flye.</p>
                        <p>In the third Watch of the night, about twelve of the clocke, Chriſt was brought to <hi>Annas,</hi> and was boxed with the hand, or beat with the rod of an Officer, which ſtood by, whom Chriſt reproved.</p>
                        <p>About one of the clocke in the morning, he was brought to <hi>Caiaphas;</hi> where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bound, he was examined; and confeſſed himſelfe to be God.</p>
                        <p>About two of the clocke in the morning, was Chriſt more ſtrictly interrogated. And now the Cocke crew; and <hi>Peter</hi> denied him thrice: and Chriſt pittying <hi>Peter</hi> looked backe on him; and he repented, went forth, and wept bitterly. In mine opinion here <hi>Selneccerus</hi> might better have placed his <hi>Canticinium,</hi> or rather the <hi>Gallicinium,</hi> or Cocke-crowing: <hi>Selneccerus</hi> is in one extreame, and would have the crowing of the Cocke in the ſecond Watch, before midnight: Others hold the <hi>Gallicinium,</hi> or Cocke-crowing, to be onely in the fourth Watch of the night, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the houres from three to foure: foure to five; five to ſixe: and they are in another extreame; for Cocks crow not ſo much in the ſecond Watch of the night, as in the third. And I confeſſe, not ſo much in the third, as in the fourth Watch; yet ſeldome or never doe they crow before midnight, unleſſe it be at Chriſtmaſſe, as the good huſwifes ſay; or upon ſome extraordinary occaſions, as when they be troubled with noyſe, or moved; or when they happen to ſee any accidently light, by fire, torch, or candle; or unleſſe it be againſt change of weather.

                           <item>1. Whither, the Cocke did crow naturally of himſelfe, or was by meanes Divine, ſpurred, ſtimulated, or puſhed on unto it?</item>
                           <item>2. How the Evangeliſts different variations may be reconciled? In which, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Quaeres are inwrapped.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Concerning the firſt, ſome may probably thinke, that our bleſſed Saviour (being <hi>Valdè Naturae mystes,</hi> acquainted exactly with the courſe of it; and divinely fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing, and fore-knowing what would come to paſſe in an uſuall, and ordinary way) was content to let the creatures, <hi>Exercere actus ſuos proprios;</hi> to exerciſe their proper acts: S. <hi>Peter</hi> to deny his Maſter for feare, yet voluntarily; and the Cocke to crow at his uſuall times. So that the Cocke did not crow, becauſe Chriſt had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told ſo much; or becauſe he was provoked otherwiſe, than of himſelfe to crow: but becauſe Chriſt fore-knew that S. <hi>Peters</hi> deniall would be about the crowing of the Cocke; therefore did Chriſt fore-tell it. But I may more probably thinke, the whole courſe was above the levell of Nature, and that Satan deſiring to winnow S. <hi>Peter.</hi> put a great and ſudden feare into him, and that Chriſt for a little time did deſert S. <hi>Peter;</hi> and turned, as it were his backe unto him. That afterward, Chriſt pittying S. <hi>Peter,</hi> did inwardly, and tacitly command the Cocke to crow; as hee in all likelihood, forbade the fiſh by ſome hidden motion, or inſtinct, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach nigh the ſhips, where S. <hi>Peter</hi> and the Apoſtles toyled all the night, and tooke nothing, <hi>Luke</hi> 5.5. and precepted the fiſh, extraordinarily, and immediatly, to come in troopes, in obedience to Chriſts Will, to this end, that his miraculous power might be the better ſeene, when they let downe their Net for one draught; and the great multitude of fiſhes breake their net, <hi>Luke</hi> 5.6. and began to ſinke their ſhips, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. And all this aſtoniſhing wonder was but divinely preparatory to make <hi>Peter</hi> beleeve the words of Chriſt, who promiſed, that thenceforth <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould catch men, <hi>Luke</hi> 5.10. and as he commanded againe, in a way beſt knowne to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, the fiſh to bring a ſtater, or halfe a crowne of ſilver in his mouth, unto the ſame S. <hi>Peter;</hi> and yet to bite at the bayte, which was faſtned on the hooke, which S. <hi>Peter</hi> caſt into the ſea, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.27. For I will not thinke that <hi>Peter</hi> caſt in an hooke without a bayte; or if he did, it was the greater wonder. All which are things above the bounds of Nature. Likewiſe, when at the crowing of the Cocke, <hi>Peter</hi> remembred the words of <hi>Jeſus, Mat.</hi> 26.75. My opinion is, the Cocke might have crowed for tie times, and S. <hi>Peter</hi> never a whit the rather have remembred the words of Chriſt; nor repented; but that our mercifull Saviour, even in the midſt of his owne ſufferings, remembred, and pittied S. <hi>Peter:</hi> for the Lord turned and looked upon S. <hi>Peter; and Peter remembred the words of the Lord, Luke</hi> 22 61. When <hi>Chriſt</hi> turned his face to <hi>Peter,</hi> and looked on him; it was an operative looke, and piercing eyes, vertue flew from them; and with divine power reached to turne <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi> now <hi>Peetr</hi> ſaw <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as well as <hi>Christ</hi> looked on <hi>Peter: Peter</hi> did read his own fault in his Maſters countenance; the language of <hi>Chriſts</hi> lookes did <hi>Peter</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand; and it was not a naturall, but a divine motion, which made him remember the words of <hi>Chriſt. Auguſtine de gratia Chriſti.</hi> 1.45. ſaith, That <hi>Chriſts</hi> looking on <hi>Peter,</hi> was ſpirituall; with the ſpirituall eyes of mercy, reducing <hi>Peter</hi> to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. He looked not on him with bodily eyes; <hi>Sed hic Auguſtinus non tenetur:</hi> Here S. <hi>Auſtine</hi> was awry. I doubt not, but <hi>Chriſt</hi> beheld <hi>Peter</hi> both corporally, and ſpiritually. Indeede, it is ſaid, <hi>Marke</hi> 14.66. <hi>Peter</hi> was beneath in the Palace warming himſelfe. And <hi>Peter</hi> was without in the Palace, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.69. and hee was gone out into the Porch, <hi>ver.</hi> 71. which imply, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> were in ſeverall roomes; <hi>Chriſt</hi> within, and above; <hi>Peter</hi> without, and beneath. I anſwer, that they were in ſeverall roomes at firſt, none can deny: but that <hi>Peter</hi> went not
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:47497:184"/>up where <hi>Chriſt</hi> was; or that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was not brought downe after judgement; ſo that hee might ſee <hi>Peter,</hi> can never be proved: for <hi>Peter</hi> went in, and ſate with the ſervants, to ſee the end, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.58. A poore ſight could he ſee, if he ſtayed ſtill without. The firſt deniall of <hi>Peter,</hi> was by the fire in the Hall; the ſecond in the Porch, when the Cocke crew firſt. No reaſon can evince, but at the ſecond crowing of the Cocke, both <hi>Ieſus</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> might be in one roome. I am ſure, it was above the ſpace of an houre, betweene the firſt and third deniall, as it fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulteth, from <hi>Luke</hi> 22.59. And upon <hi>Peters</hi> firſt deniall the Cocke firſt crew. And, <hi>Then they led Ieſus from Caiphas unto the Iudgement-hall.</hi> At which time, he might ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well looke upon <hi>Peter,</hi> if <hi>Peter</hi> himſelfe had not followed, into the roome, where <hi>Chriſt</hi> was condemned, as it is moſt likely he did.</p>

                        <p>I Anſwer briefely to the firſt; the words of <hi>Ieſus</hi> were ſpoken, as they are in Saint <hi>Marke;</hi> and the word twice is to be underſtood, and by way of ſenſe, is to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the other three Evangeliſts.

Neither <hi>Matthew, Luke,</hi> nor <hi>Iohn,</hi> ſay negatively Chriſt ſpake no other words, but theſe; if they, or any of them had ſo ſaid, there had beene an irreconcileable contradiction unto S. <hi>Marke.</hi> But they ſaying onely; Theſe were the words of <hi>Ieſus.

                        <p>TO the third <hi>Quaere.</hi> How often S. <hi>Peter</hi> was queſtioned, or vouched to be Chriſts Diſciple.</p>
                        <p>I anſwer, It ſeemeth cleerely by the Evangeliſts; that S. <hi>Peter</hi> was doubted of by ſome; and affirmed by others to be <hi>Chriſts</hi> Diſciple, divers times; but they muſt be reduced all to three onely; for you are to conſider all foure Evangeliſts agree; The firſt, who ſpake of <hi>Peter,</hi> was the Maide, the doore-keeper. The other Maide ſpake of <hi>Peter,</hi> not to him, but upon her ſpeech, a man ſaid; <hi>Thou art alſo of them</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Luke.</hi>) The Maides talking, and the Mans accuſing, are to be held, as one enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or affirmation. Then not one, after one; but divers almoſt at once fell upon S. <hi>Peter.</hi> They ſaid unto him, <hi>Art not thou alſo one of his Diſciples? Ioh.</hi> 18.25. who thoſe <hi>(They)</hi> were, S. <hi>Matth.</hi> ſetteth downe; <hi>viz. They, that ſtood by:</hi> which might be the very ſame men, that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> meaneth; though firſt they interrogated, as it is in S. <hi>Iohn;</hi> and after bluntly, and boldly affirmed it (as it is in S. <hi>Matth.</hi>) and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly among that company might be the confident-affirmer in <hi>Luke:</hi> and <hi>Malchus</hi>
                           <pb n="360" facs="tcp:47497:185"/>his cozen, in <hi>Iohn.</hi> So he was queſtioned, or affirmed to be a Diſciple; once by the Doore-keeper; once by a Man from another womans words; and the third time by Troopes, or Routes; or many together; three times in all.</p>

                           <hi>Cajetan,</hi> on <hi>Iohn</hi> 18. thinketh, that he was ſeven times under the file of examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; thrice by Maides, or Women; foure times by Men. But the witty <hi>Cajetan</hi> might have conſidered, the Apoſtles relate the ſame thing, though in divers man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſome inhering in one circumſtance, ſome in another: and as I ſaid; The ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall relations may deſigne out the ſame perſons, and did; as ſeverall ſayings of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> made up but his thrice deniall. If hee had well weighed this, he would not alſo have determined as he hath done; That S. <hi>Peter</hi> denied <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſeven times, thrice to the Women, foure times to the Men; which reacheth home to—</p>

                        <p>THe next <hi>Quare;</hi> the fourth in number: How many times <hi>Peter</hi> denyed <hi>Chriſt?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Whatſoever <hi>Cajetans</hi> account is, I beleeve that S. <hi>Peter</hi> denied our Saviour but Thrice. Firſt, becauſe our Lord three times inſiſted on that fixed number of thrice; <hi>Thou ſhalt deny me thrice.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The firſt time was upon this occaſion: <hi>Zachary</hi> foretold, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> poynts at the place; <hi>I will ſmite the Shepheard, and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhall be ſcattered.</hi> S. <hi>Peter</hi> profeſſed he would not be offended; <hi>Chriſt</hi> replied, S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould deny him thrice, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.34. S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, he will not; and did out-argue <hi>Chriſt</hi> in words.</p>
                        <p>A ſecond occaſion was this. Satan had winnowed <hi>Indas,</hi> and prevailed; and would have winnowed S. <hi>Peter,</hi> but <hi>Chriſt</hi> prayed for him, and Satan prevailed not, to his finall overthrow. But when <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid to <hi>Peter; When thou art converted ſtrengthen thy brethren;</hi> his fall was fore-ſeene, implyed, and fore-told, before his converſion. Yet againe, when the forward undertaking S. <hi>Peter</hi> avouched the contrary, <hi>Chriſt</hi> replied, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.34. <hi>Thou ſhalt deny me thrice.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A third occaſion was this. S <hi>Peter</hi> would know whither <hi>Chriſt</hi> went; <hi>Chriſt</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, S. <hi>Peter</hi> could not then follow him, <hi>Why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay downe my life for thy ſake,</hi> quoth the great Preſumer or Promiſer. <hi>Christ</hi> anſwered him a third time, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.38. <hi>The Cocke ſhall not crow</hi> (or the ordinary time of Cocke-crowing ſhall not come) <hi>till thou haſt denied me thrice.</hi> Hence I frame mine Argument,</p>

                        <p>IF <hi>Chriſt</hi> three times, ſo ſolemnly, upon ſo many ſeverall provocations, when his Apoſtle did out-crow him; did foretell, That he ſhould deny <hi>Chriſt</hi> thrice, not ſixe, not ſeven times, not more, not leſſe; but onely thrice: The Triple diction of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> was ſeconded with a Triple deniall of his Apoſtle, and with no more.

                        <p>I anſwer, <hi>Chriſts</hi> intent was to humble S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and to make him ſee his owne frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, in his over-forwardneſſe. Therefore if <hi>Chriſt</hi> had knowne <hi>Peter</hi> would have denyed him ſeven times, he would not have leſſened the number of his denyalls, but have named all his ſeven denialls; the rather to beate downe his ſelfe-love, ſelfe-conceit, ſelfe-aſſurance. But <hi>Chriſt</hi> fore-telling onely three denyalls, we may not forge more, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> could not be ignorant of, if ſuch were to have beene, and would not have ſpared to tell <hi>Peter</hi> ſo.</p>

Though divers did interrogate, or affirme the ſame thing; yet was the anſwer but one, and the ſame. I end, as I ſaid before.</p>
                        <p>The firſt deniall accompliſhed was to the Maide, the doore-keeper. The ſecond denyall, was to a ſingle ſeverall accuſer, a Man, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.58. A little while after, upon a Womans ſuggeſtion (for though S. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſpeaketh of a ſecond Maide, or Woman, yet the ſecond Maide ſpake not to <hi>Peter,</hi> but of <hi>Peter</hi> to others, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.71. and <hi>Marke</hi> 14.69. <hi>This is one of them:</hi> and then, and thereupon) a Man charged him home; and ſo indeede the ſecond deniall. About an houre after one confidently affirmed (as it is in S. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.59.) and others interrogated, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18.25. and the By-ſtanders avouched. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.73. and perhaps <hi>Malchus</hi> his cozen might be one of thoſe troupes; though poynted out ſingly; and they all in likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, came upon S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſo faſt, one in the necke of another, as is uſuall when many talke together, that he anſwered All, and each of them, with this third reſolute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyall.</p>
                        <p>The firſt, was a ſimple denyall, <hi>I know not what thou ſayſt, Matth.</hi> 26.70.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond denyall, upon a mans direct accuſing him, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.58. After a Womans confident avouchment, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.71. was not ſingle, and ſimple, but Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramentall, <hi>Verſ</hi> 72.</p>
                        <p>The third deniall, upon the charge of ſo many, ſome ſingle, ſome in a route, was imprecatory, and made him both curſe and ſweare, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26 74. and <hi>Marke</hi> 14.71. though neither S. <hi>Luke,</hi> nor S. <hi>Iohn</hi> mention his ſwearing, or curſing.</p>

                        <p>I have not heard, nor read, any man avouching, more than two crowings of the Cocke.

But if Chriſt and his Apoſtles ſung an Hymne, at the end of the ſecond Supper, it was not that Long-one; for this being no fixed rite, no commanded ceremonie, Chriſt and his Apoſtles were not tyed unto it: and it may be thereupon Chriſt put it over to the end of the moſt Sacred Euchariſt, and to the end of his Divine Sermons in <hi>Coenaculo.</hi> For I take theſe two things, as confeſſed principles.

                        <p>The inſtitution of the venerable Euchariſt, is for the ſubſtantiall part thereof, ſet down at large by three Evangeliſts, and by S. <hi>Paul.</hi> But for the time, place, and manner of adminiſtring: what preparatives were uſed by word, or deed; with what geſtures Chriſt did celebrate: and the Apoſtles receive that bleſſed Sacrament: what Reverence was ſhewed; what Prayers Precedent, Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitant, or Subſequent were made, is not directly expreſſed in holy Scripture. Scarce ever was there an holy ſubject more ſubject to various conſtructions. For we are forced to ſeek for the light without any ſhine of it: the aſhes muſt bee blown away, and hidden corners ſearched. Fire is produced by a ſtrong apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the flint to the ſteele; and we muſt be as tinder dryed, and apt to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the leaſt flying ſpark: points unwritten muſt be extracted, and diſtilled out of things written.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore (good Chriſtian people whoſoever you be that are unlearned, and can talke only of our Engliſh originall, forbeare cenſure in theſe dubious points: be willinger to follow, than to lead: to learne, than to determine.</p>
                        <p>But come you hither, (O ye inquiſitive, and learned Conjecturers.) Here is work for you; and in this work, let me intreat you rather to build, than to deſtroy: to cut of, rather than multiply perplexities. And you (dainty Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks) the ſweet Children of the Arts, and Muſes; you mines, and minters of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, come with your nimble fancies, and pricking apprehenſions, towring beyond ſight: fetch light out of darkneſſe, adde improvement to learning, and truth; and ſtrength of reaſon to conjecture.</p>
                        <p>And you eſpecially, (moſt Reverend and Holy divines) the true Epoptae, Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards of the myſteries of God, and beholders of his ſecrets, who daily converſe with God, and his bleſſed Angels: who ſpend not your thoughts on the ſtinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing traſh of this filthy world; whoſe death to the world, is life to Godward: and who are, <hi>Finita divitiarum cupiditate divites,</hi> rich, in that you covet not riches: Whileſt an earthworme, or muckworme is, <hi>Medias inter opes inops,</hi> poore (like <hi>Tantalus</hi>) in the middeſt of his riches.

Divinely is the ſtory of <hi>Jonas</hi> recorded in the old Teſtament.

                        <p>And behold whilſt I was writing of this paſſage, I received a gratulatory letter from that <hi>Mundus eruditionis,</hi> that living Library, the moſt eminent <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius profeſſor</hi> of Divinity, Doctor <hi>Collins</hi> Provoſt of our Kings Colledge in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> in theſe very words; So wiſhing you <hi>Tri-Neſtora</hi>

                        <p>Therefore I have preſumed upon the Triple Supper at which our Saviour was preſent in one night, the laſt night that he lived in this world a naturall common life, <hi>viz.</hi> The Paſchal ſolemnity, the ordinary Supper, the thrice-ſacred-Supper of our Lord and Saviour, to terme all three joyned together, or continued, <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caenium,</hi> the threefold Supper of Chriſt. To the proofes in the ſecond book for a threcfold Supper, let me now adde the words of <hi>Juſtinian</hi> the Jeſuit on 1 Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth. 11.20. <hi>Solet triplex caena diſtingui; Legalis ſeu typica, quâ agnus Paſchalis comedebatur: Myſtica, ſeu nova, quae ſpectat ad Sacramenti inſtitutionem: tertia communis, quae ad azymorum uſum inchoandum inſtituta erat.</hi> The threefold Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is uſually diſtinguiſht into the Legal or Typical, wherein the Paſchal Lamb was eaten: the Myſtical or new Supper, which belongs to the inſtitution of the Sacrament: and the Third or common Supper, which was ordained to begin the uſe of unleavened bread. Though <hi>Juſtinian</hi> erre in the order, placing the Supper of the Lord before the Common Supper; and though he erre in the reaſon, becauſe the Jewes did eate their Paſchal Supper with unleavened bread, before the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Supper was brought in, and ſo the Second Supper did not begin the uſe of unleavened bread: yet in the maine, for Three Suppers he is in the right.</p>
                        <p>Nor can I well digeſt, that the Papiſts are ſo vehemently offended with our men, for calling the Third Supper, the Supper of our Lord. <hi>Eſtius, Franciſcus, Lucas Brugenſis,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Maldonate</hi> (if the words be not fathered on him.) Any name almoſt better pleaſeth them, than that (the Supper of our Lord.)</p>
                        <p>In my <hi>Miſcellanies,</hi> and in the ſecond book of this <hi>Tricaenium,</hi> I have beene very bitter againſt the maledicency and ſcolding of the Jeſuit <hi>Maldonate.</hi> And in truth the words in his book deſerve ſharp reprehenſion, and recrimination, as being too full of ſpleene, partiality, calumny, and baſe untruth. That I wrote ſo eagerly againſt the perſon of the man, I am ſorry: For I have been credibly informed lately by one (who in all likelihood knew the inſide of ſuch buſineſſe) even my very learned good friend Mr <hi>John Salkeld,</hi> that <hi>Maldonate</hi> in his life was eſteemed a moderate Papiſt, yea a favourer of our Religion; and after his death, that his Commentaries on the Goſpels did ſuffer, by divers other more factious Jeſuits both diſpunctions and additions, with ſtrange alterations. <hi>Da magiſtrum,</hi> give me my maſter, quoth <hi>Cyprian</hi> of <hi>Tertullian.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The right reverend father in God, <hi>Richard,</hi> now Lord Biſhop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> was ſometimes my Preſident, whilſt I was chamber-fellow with him in the Kings Colledge in <hi>Cambridge.</hi> His writings have I delighted in. His moſt learned <hi>Apparatus</hi> was I (on other occaſions) reading: when unexpectedly (as I was writing my excuſe of <hi>Maldonate</hi>) I found the ſame opinion confirmed by him, another way. I rather think (ſaith he) <hi>Apparatu</hi> 7. <hi>Paragrapho</hi> 16. that other <hi>Maſſipontane</hi> Jeſuits did interſert into <hi>Maldonate</hi> his Commentaries when he was dead, the railings againſt our men; ſince <gap reason="foreign">

                           <hi>Hiſtoricus Thuanus,</hi> that moſt true hiſtorian <hi>Thuanus</hi> relateth, that <hi>Maldonate</hi> was a moſt modeſt man. But in his Commentaries are moſt ſcurrilous revilings, which could never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reed from Modeſty, I date ſay. The ſame day alſo, I overviewing (upon other
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:47497:193"/>occaſions) the learned <hi>Caſaubone,</hi> found to my hand as caſually as <hi>Abraham</hi> found the Ram, and <hi>Iſaac</hi> the veniſon (as he ſaid) that <hi>Exercitatione</hi> 16. <hi>cap.</hi> 32. he ſaith of <hi>Maldonate</hi> that he was a learned man, <hi>&amp; ſine controverſiâ, acerrimi ingenii:</hi> Now, whether he meaned that out of doubt, and confeſſedly he was of excellent parts, and of a moſt keen ſharp wit: or that he was a ſharp-witted man, except when he medled with controverſies, I did ſomewhat doubt. For <hi>Caſaubone</hi> could not but have read (and perhaps to it he alluded) what <hi>Aulus Gellius lib.</hi> 10. <hi>c.</hi> 15. hath written, <hi>viz.</hi> that when <hi>Antonius Julianus</hi> the Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rician, had heard a rich ill-bred Gentleman too too talkative in a doubtfull, if not unexplicable controverſie; he ſaid privately, moſt facetiouſly, and with an exceeding bitter irriſion, <hi>Adoleſcens hic, ſine controverſiâ, diſertus eſt:</hi> If he meddle not in hard points, he is an eloquent young man.</p>
                        <p>But paſſing by the man, let us come to the matter: the ground why I call it the Third Supper, is, becauſe when the Paſchal and the Common Supper were eaten before: the bleſſed Euchariſt was inſtituted in the laſt place; and the ſame holy Euchariſt is tearmed by the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> 1 Corinth. 11.20. The Supper of the Lord: <hi>this is not to eate the Lords Supper.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Concerning the Third Supper, it is nowhere in Scripture called a Supper, ſaith <hi>Maldonate</hi> on <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.26. and in this point falleth a ſcoffing thus. The <hi>Calviniſts</hi> without authority of Scripture, without example of old writers, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon, without judgement, call it a Supper, when they ought rather to call it Merenda, a bever, if they take it after dinner: a dinner, if they take it at noon: a breakfaſt, if they take it in the morning. Yet <hi>Maldonate</hi> himſelfe calleth it ſo: his fellow Jeſuits call it ſo: <hi>Cyprian</hi> and other Fathers call it <hi>Canam Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi> the Supper of the Lord. <hi>Caena Dei,</hi> the Supper of God in <hi>Tertullian.</hi> The ſame <hi>Maldonate</hi> on <hi>John</hi> 13.2. <hi>Tres caenas Chriſtus (ut nonnulli authores ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervarunt) illâ nocte fecit:</hi> Chriſt (as ſome authors have obſerved) made Three Suppers in the ſame night (in which he was betrayed.) The firſt was the Legal Surper of the Paſchal Lambe. The ſecond was the Common Supper (the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal being ended, which was not ordeined ſo much to ſatiate and nouriſh na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as to keep the Legal Ceremony) that they, who had eaten the Lambe, if they wanted more meate to ſatisfie themſelves, might be filled with ordinary meates. Conſider (Reader) if theſe two teſtimonies from him do not hack one another.</p>
                        <p>If it be objected, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith, <hi>Dominus poſt ceremoniam agni Paſcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis continuò ſubjunxit celebrationem Euchariſtiae; nec diſtulit in aliud tempus, aut locum, ut apertè oſtenderet, ſe novâ iſtâ coremoniâ coremoniâ finem imponere veteri.</hi> The Lord after the Ceremony of the Paſchal Lambe, did preſently ſubjoyne the celebrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the (bleſſed) Euchariſt: neither did he put it over till another time or place, that he might plainly ſhew that he did impoſe an end to the old (Law) by that new ceremony. From which words it may ſeeme to reſult that there was no ſecond Supper.</p>
                        <p>I anſwer: <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſpeakes not of the <hi>Sacrificium agni,</hi> the Sacrifice of the Lamb, but of the <hi>Ceremonia agni Paſchalis,</hi> of the ceremony of the Paſchal Lamb; which may very truly be extended to the end of the ſecond Supper. The ſecond Supper treading (as itwere) on the heels of the firſt, and the Paſchal Lambe or the fleſh therof ſtanding ſtill on the table unremoved, till the end of the ſecond Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. And thus <hi>Bellarmine</hi> may ſeeme to be rather for us, than againſt us.</p>

And St. <hi>Paul</hi> divinely teacheth them, firſt
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:47497:193"/>negatively, that they eat not the Supper of the Lord, when they eat their owne ſupper one before another, verſ. 20.21. or when ſome were hungry, ſome drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; and that in the Church of God: whereupon he telleth them, they had houſes to eat and drink in, and will by no meanes praiſe their doings, ver. 22.</p>
                        <p>Secondly poſitively; that they truly eat the Supper of the Lord, who follow Chriſt for their patterne, and imitate his example: and ſo by conſequence ſheweth the right inſtitution of the Lords Supper, which was his maine intent fully to declare againſt all concomitant abuſes, to that end that they might follow it accordingly.</p>
                        <p>As the Euchariſt came in the roome of the Paſchal, ſo the Agapae after Chriſts time ſucceeded in the place of the Second Supper of the Jewes.</p>

                        <p>Firſt, before <hi>Tertullians</hi> time the Euchariſt was given and taken in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Secondly, The Agapae were in the evening. Thirdly, Yet at the firſt they were both about the ſame time. Let me ſay a little of each point.</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. For the receiving of the Sacrament in the morning, <hi>Tertullian ad uxorem</hi> thus: <hi>Non ſciot maritus quid ſecreto ante omnem cibum guſtes?</hi> Shall not thy huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band know what thou doſt eat in ſecret, before thou doſt caſte a bit of any other meat? And after him Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> would have the Euchariſt eaten faſting, <hi>propter honorem Corporis Dominici,</hi> out of a religious reverence to the Lords Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. More plainly the ſame <hi>Tertullian in lib. de corona militis; Euchariſtiae Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum—etiam antelucanis coetibus, nec de aliorum manu, quàm de praſiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium ſumimus;</hi> we receive the Sacrament of the bleſſed Euchariſt even at our morning meetings, and that at the hand of no other but of our owne Miniſters. And <hi>Pliny,</hi> who was <hi>Rationalis Trajani, Trajans</hi> Receiver and Accountant, did certifie the Emperour, that the Chriſtians were wont to meet before day light, <hi>ut ſua ſacra facerent,</hi> to performe their divine ſervice.</item>
                           <item>2. Concerning the ſecond point, namely the Agapae, that they were kept in the evening, is as apparent. <hi>Coena noſtra de nomine rationem ſui reddit. Vocatur enim</hi>

                              </gap> our Supper is called a Love-feaſt. <hi>Quantiſcunque ſumptibus conſtat, lucrum eſt pietatis nomine facere ſumptum: ſiquidem inopes quoque iſto refrigerio juvamus.</hi> How coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſoever our Love-feaſts be, expence for pietie ſake is gaine; for the poore are refreſhed with it. <hi>Auguſtinus contra Fauſtum</hi> 20.20. <hi>Agapae noſtrae pauperes paſcunt, ſive frugibus, ſive carmbus:</hi> Our Love-feaſts doe feed the poore, either with bread, or meat; one way or other.</item>
                           <item>3. The third point is as evident from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. that the Primitive Chriſtians kept no great diſtance of time betweene the ſacred Euchariſt and the Agapae: For the Apoſtle proceedeth from the abuſes of one, to prevent the abuſes which might fall in the other, and ſpeaketh as of things almoſt conjoyned. And from hence the Gentiles objected, that Chriſtians at their Love-feaſts did eat an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant; becauſe the bleſſed Euchariſt was in the ſame Agapae, or neere the time adminiſtred; and it being called ſpiritually the Fleſh, and the Blood of Chriſt, the Chriſtians were accuſed that they did eat mans fleſh, and drinke mans blood.</item>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Alba-ſpinaeus</hi> doth anſwer very ſhallowly, That this crime was forged, even from the daies of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith in his <hi>Apologetick.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I reply. All this is true, that it was a moſt horrid falſhood, an affected Lie, coined in <hi>Tiborius</hi> his time. But the queſtion is not, Whether the ſame were
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:47497:194"/>true, or falſe; (to which only <hi>Alba-ſpinaeus</hi> ſupinely but idlely anſwereth) but from what ground or probability the rumour did ariſe, or how we may trace the report home to its owne forme, to the bed from whence it firſt ſtarted. I ſay againe, It was becauſe the Euchariſt and the Agapae were conjoyned, and were then kept at Night-ſeaſon: thereupon they found fault with the Suppers of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, as ſated with blood and humane fleſh. And perhaps in after times this was one true reaſon why they are the bleſſed Sacrament in the morning, and the Agapae at night, to remove that objection; That in the night they feaſted not themſelves with the blood of an Infant. Which practice, though it ſtaggered the report, and ſomeway diverted it, and the Chriſtians <hi>abſoluti ſunt,</hi> were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted; yet <hi>litura manebat,</hi> the ſpot was not cleane taken away, as <hi>Claudius</hi> was wont to ſay in another caſe <hi>&amp; aliquid haerebat,</hi> but ſomething ſtill remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned behind, becauſe the accuſation was boldly vouched. Inveterate rumours are not eaſily wiped out.</p>
                        <p>If <hi>Alba-ſpinaeus</hi> had obſerved, that at their ſingle ſeparated Agapae there was no poſſibility of ſuſpition of Infanticide, or feeding on mans fleſh, or drinking of mans blood, but that the words of the body and blood of Chriſt eaten, and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, might in the carnal miſ-interpretation be <hi>Caput famae,</hi> a ground (though ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery) for report, and for ſuch a report, through their malice and infidelity; he would then have ſaid (without a perhaps) that for a good while after Chriſts time both the Euchariſt and the Love-feaſts did touch or kiſſe each the other; and that thence aroſe the horrid imputation, that their Suppers were accuſed as <hi>ſceleris in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fames,</hi> infamous for villanies, to uſe <hi>Tertullians</hi> phraſe. Weigh this farther cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance. The Agapae were kept on the Lords day: <hi>Diebus Dominicis celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant Agapas,</hi> they celebrated their Love-feaſts on the Lords day, ſaith <hi>Alba-ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> himſelfe, <hi>obſervat.</hi> 18. and then was the moſt bleſſed Euchariſt adminiſtred; that day above all other dayes, that time of the day, even about Supper time, in imitation of our Lord.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Tertullian ad uxorem</hi> 2.4. ſpeaketh of Pagan husbands ſuſpition of their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian wives: <hi>Quis ad Convivium Dominicum illud, quod infamant, ſine ſua ſuspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione dimittet?</hi> Who can endure to let his wife goe to that infamous banquet of the Lord without jealouſie? What this <hi>Convivium Dominicum,</hi> this Banquet of the Lord is, falleth under enquiry. <hi>Pamelius</hi> interpreteth it, <hi>de Miſſa Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum,</hi> of the Chriſtians Maſſe. <hi>Rhenanus, Junius, Mornaeus, Caſaubonus Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citat.</hi> 6. <hi>pag.</hi> 512. interpreteth it of the Euchariſt. <hi>Alba-ſpinaeus</hi> in his notes on this place of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> thus farre concludeth wittily and truly, That <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaketh of that Banquet or Feaſt that was infamous among the Gentiles. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivium illud, quod infamant,</hi> are the very words of <hi>Tertullian.</hi> But they were not ſuſpected of any inceſt at the Euchariſt, ſaith <hi>Alba-ſpinaeus,</hi> or of any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull luſt then, as from <hi>Pliny junior</hi> and others may appeare. Therefore thoſe ſcandals were only taken againſt the Agapae, or Love-feaſts. What things are objected againſt the Chriſtians, <hi>in Justin, adverſus-Judaeos Apolog.</hi> 2. In <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian Apologet.</hi> and <hi>ad Scapulam, De cultu foeminarum,</hi> in <hi>Minutius Foelix,</hi> in <hi>Euſebius</hi> 4.1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. <hi>capitibus,</hi> concerning their Suppers, and Infanticide, they are to be referred to the Agapae, in which the Euchariſt was neither conſecrated, nor received. Thus farre <hi>White-thorne,</hi> or <hi>Alba-ſpinaeus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But if he had obſerved, either that at their Agapae only there was no poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of ſuſpition concerning Infanticide, and that at the Euchariſt a carnall man might ſo interpret it; or that the Euchariſt was held by the Gentiles worſe than the Agapae, ſo much worſe, as Infanticide, and devouring humane fleſh and blood, are worſe than the ſins of the eighth Commandement; or that the holy Euchariſt and the Agapae were kept both at one time, about Supper time, in the dayes Apoſtolicall: and the Euchariſt being firſt diſpatched, the ſuſpition for luſt was laid upon the Second Supper, where they did feaſt, ſing, and were merry: and that <hi>Tertullian Apologetico cap.</hi> 39. mentioneth the <hi>Triclintum Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianorum,</hi>
                           <pb n="529" facs="tcp:47497:194"/>the Supping-beds of the Chriſtians, and their diſcumbing thereon, both men and women: I ſay againe, he would have concluded without a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, that the bleſſed Euchariſt and the Agapae were not diſ-ſundred by much time, but rather were united; and he would not have rejected, as he did, both his owne and our Heroes, <hi>Pamelius, Rhenanus, Junius, Mornaeus, Caſaubone,</hi> to whom let me add that learned Jeſuit <hi>Ludovicus de la Cerda,</hi> who interpreteth <hi>Dominicum Convivium,</hi> the Lords Supper, thus; <hi>Convivium Domini peragebatur, celebrabaturque ſacrâ Euchariſtiâ: ac tunc menticbantur Gentiles, ac dicebant, Chriſtianos panem ſacrum Euchariſtiae edere intinctum ſanguine jugulati Infantis:</hi> So farre <hi>Cerda.</hi> The Banquet of the Lord was kept and celebrated at the ſacred Euchariſt: and then did the Gentiles falſly report, and ſay, that the Chriſtians did eat the ſacred bread of the Euchariſt dipped in the blood of a butchered In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant. I may not omit it is called <hi>Dei coena,</hi> the Supper of God, in <hi>Tertullian ad uxorem</hi> 2.6. And that <hi>Alba-ſpinaeus</hi> in all his Obſervations obſerved not that the Agapae or Love-feaſts did ſucceed the Second Supper of the Jewes, at all their great feaſts: which Suppers were for the moſt part contiguous, and never farre diſ-ſundred. <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtata taxed the Chriſtians for theſe three alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <gap reason="foreign">

Thus did the Agapae, or Love-feaſts, ſucceed in the roome of the Second Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Supper. After the Sacraments were adminiſtred they feaſted altogether.</p>

                        <p>THe Papiſts ſay, That the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the Agapae, or Love-feaſts, and not of the ſacred Euchariſt; as I proved before. Suffer me, I pray you, to cleere the text concerning the Agapae.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Firſt, I would know where any, or whoever called the Agapae, or Love-feaſts, the Supper of the Lord. <hi>Tertullian</hi> indeed <hi>Apologetic. cap.</hi> 39. calleth their Love-feaſt, <hi>Coenam,</hi> a Supper; but that ever he or any other called it, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled by it ſelfe, <hi>Coenam Domini,</hi> the Supper of the Lord, with reference to the Sacrament, I remember not. As Agapae were doled to the poore (and what is given to them is lent to the Lord) ſo it may be called the Lords Supper.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Secondly, the Agapae, or Love-feaſts, were never begun or practiſed by Chriſt, never in uſe whileſt Chriſt lived on the earth, in likelihood not till after he was aſcended into heaven, ſome ſhort time after: ſo they were of a latter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution than the bleſſed Sacrament, though they were holy, juſt, conſcionable, and founded on ſufficient good authority, viz. Divine.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Thirdly, if there had beene no abuſe In or At the Agapae, or Love-feaſts among the Corinthians, yet the righteſt uſe of them could never produce this Conſequent; That, that was to eat the Supper of the Lord, which muſt be the reſultance from the opinion of the Papiſts. For none can deny but the Church did ſometimes uſe the Agapae, or Love-feaſts, holily and heavenly; And yet it was a different thing, To eat the Lords Supper. Both the Supper of the Lord, and the Agapae, or Love-feaſts, might be, and have beene perfectly adminiſtred, ſeverally, and at ſeverall houres and watches of the day, or night: alſo jointly, and contiguouſly, one preſently after the other: ſometimes the one firſt, and ſometimes the other.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Fourthly, the Agapae, or Love-feaſts, ſucceeded indeed in the roome of the Second, or Common Supper. And it is as cleere as the light, that the Corinthians did firſt eat their Agapa's, or Love-feaſts: Every one taketh before his own Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.21.</p>
                        <p n="5">

5. Fifthly, Theſe Corinthian Agapae, or Love-feaſts, were celebrated in the Church. For the Apoſtle reprooveth them, becauſe they did not eat at Home, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they came to the Church. <hi>What, have ye not Houſes to eat and drink in? or deſpiſe ye the Church of God? ver.</hi> 22.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Sixthly, There being diviſions among the Corinthians, <hi>v.</hi> 18. it is more than likely, that the maintainers of each Schiſme ſupped Apart, by Themſelves; thereby fomenting diviſions, and cheriſhing factions.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Seventhly, It is probable, that the Rich ſupped by Themſelves: For certain it is, that the Poore were neglected. <hi>Ye ſhame them that are poore, or that have not,</hi> ver. 22. <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>
                           <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaketh much in commendation of theſe Love-feaſts. <hi>Inopes quoſque refrigerio iſto juvamus:</hi> we relieve every Poore body by that refection of ours (ſaith hee <hi>Apologet. cap.</hi> 39.)

                        <p>EIghthly, as by the words, <hi>One is hungry,</hi> we may not imagine, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle confined his meaning to ſingly <hi>One,</hi> to <hi>Onely One,</hi> and no other: ſo when he ſaith, <hi>Another is drunken,</hi> he appropriateth not the fault to meer-One-alone, as if no more were drunken; but modeſtly covering their faults, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably caſting, as it were, a mantle over their nakedneſſe, what was too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon among them, he qualifieth, modifieth, and diminiſheth, by reducing all to the ſingular number, <hi>One is drunken.</hi>

                        <p n="9">9. Ninthly, Though the Maine abuſes, if not All, reprehended by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in theſe Corinthians, were committed <hi>in Agapis,</hi> Before the receiving of the Lords Supper; yet becauſe theſe diſorders were ill preparatories unto the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly food of their ſoules, wicked in themſelves, and ſcandalous to others; though they did receive the Lords Supper afterwards, yet this was not the way to eat the Lords Supper. <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>That the Churches did ſo, and did well, to do ſo, in later times, is confeſſed.</p>
                        <p>That ſome Churches did take the holy Communion, Early, and Faſting in the fourth Age, is alſo confeſſed. It was a fault objected againſt <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> that he gave the Communion <hi>Poſt ſumptum cibum,</hi> after the Chriſtians had bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken their faſt. The <hi>Romans</hi> uſed this peculiar king of action; when they ſwore, they took up a ſtone, and did fling it from them, and prayed; May <hi>Jupiter</hi> throw me away, as I fling away this ſtone, if I ſpeak not truth. The good old father S. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> was much moved, with that falſe ſuggeſtion: and thereupon, with enough, if not too much, earneſtneſſe, He perhaps alluded, to the oathes of the Gentiles, but certainly ſwore in Chriſtian tearmes, If I have done ſo, let Chriſt caſt me out of his Kingdome. In his ſeven and twentieth <hi>Homily in</hi> 1 <hi>Epiſtolam ad Corinthios,</hi> he ſaith, you, before you receive (the holy Euchariſt) do Faſt: that you may ſome way, or other, ſeem worthy to Communicate: and if that be a ſound Rule in the Decretals, that None ſhould beare witneſſe, but Faſting: whereby they may the better conſider what they ſweare: I judge that <hi>propter dignitatem corporis Dominici,</hi> for the honor of the Lords body no ſuſtenance ſhould be taken, before the bleſſed food (which ſtrengtheneth our ſoules) be taken by us. And yet if <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> had adminiſtred the Sacrament after meat, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanceth in the example of our bleſſed Lord. <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>I ſay with <hi>Montanus,</hi> that in thoſe times, <hi>Euchariſtiae Sacramentum repetebant aſſiduè:</hi> They tooke the bleſſed Sacrament of the Euchariſt daily: and with <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,</hi> that by the word <hi>(Bread)</hi> the Hebrews underſtood all kinde of meats: and will not deny, but the Hebrews did make their bread broad and thinne, that they were rather broken than cut. But ſince there is mention both of Breaking of <hi>Bread,</hi> and eating of <hi>Meate:</hi> I ſhall appropriate the firſt to the holy <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> the ſecond, to their <hi>feaſts of charity:</hi> and be bold to averre, that theſe words in the cited places, deſigne both. And I wiſh, that <hi>Beza</hi> had noted, that though the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did abuſe both, their bleſſed <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and their <hi>Love-feaſts</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by mingling one with another, and profaning the Churches in making them places of common repaſt: yet this was ſomewhat After this ſtory in the ſecond of the <hi>Acts;</hi> when the <hi>Agapae</hi> ſucceeded the bleſſed <hi>Sacrament;</hi> as the ſecond Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſucceeded their <hi>Paſchall.</hi> For their Breaking of Bread, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Eating of Meate. And I thinke the degrees were theſe. They daily continued in the Temple; There was the place of prayer, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.1. They are their Bread, their ſacred Bread, <hi>Domatim,</hi> at Home, or from houſe to houſe; or, at one time in ſeverall houſes. For in the Temple they could not doe ſo: perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and the ſword hung over them.</p>

A private houſe could not affoord competent roome, and decent ſpaces for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove three thouſand to receive day by day. And therefore they imployed diverſe houſes to that purpoſe. Though it be ſaid, they were All together, verſe 44. yet, (ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>) not in One place, or roome; but All together in Grace, faith, charity, unity of the Spirit, and ſingleneſſe of heart, verſ. 46.

                        <p>After this, in the third place, were their Love-feaſts carefully tended, and ordered by the Apoſtles themſelves at firſt; and then was no abuſe. But when the number of the Diſciples increaſed, the Apoſtles applyed themſelves to Better things, and left the guidance of Love-feaſts in part to others. Then crept in partiality and diſcontent; and there aroſe a murmuring of the Grecians, againſt the Hebrews, becauſe <hi>their widowes were neglected, in the daily adminiſtration, Act.</hi> 6.1. Their Love-feaſts were daily adminiſtred, as well as the bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>
                        <p>Whereupon the twelve Apoſtles called the multitude of Diſciples unto them, and ſaid; <hi>It is not reaſon we ſhould leave the word of God, and ſerve Tables,</hi> verſ. 2. <gap reason="foreign">

                           <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Et becauſe it is a vanity to inſtitute any new matters, unleſſe men be moved to it by very good reaſons, and lawfull inducements: Let us now examine, Why this Third holy Supper was inſtituted: and we ſhall finde, that the Ends were diverſe. I will inſtance in ſome: and, 1. Firſt in this; It was Appointed to this purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> to Subſtantiate the Preceding Type. There is great difference between Fulfilling of a Law, and Realizing, or Conſummating of a Type. By Eating the Paſchall Chriſt did as the Law commanded, and in that point fulfilled the Law: but if he had not Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perinduced a Third Supper, nor given us the moſt bleſſed Euchariſt to be our Evangelicall Paſch, or Paſſeover, he had not actuated the Type, nor accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed the Figure, nor eſtabliſhed the new light, and preſent truth, in ſtead of the precedent ſhadow. For when Chriſt was circumciſed, though he was obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the Law, and thereby fulfilled that Law: yet till he inſtituted Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme to be in the roome of Circumciſion, he did not Realize, or Subſtantiate the Figure: But when he had appointed new Sacraments, more full of Grace, and every way more excellent, more eaſie, and parable, and fewer in number, which were preſigned, and fore-deſtinied, and preſignified by the Types; Then indeed, and not till Then, were the Figures ſubſtantiated. And to returne home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, by the Eating of the moſt bleſſed Euchariſt in Chriſt his Third and Laſt Supper, is Chriſt become Our true Paſchall Lambe; <hi>Paſcha noſtrum immolatus eſt Chriſtus,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.7. <hi>Chriſt our Paſſeover is ſlaine.</hi> I grant that S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of the Crucifixion, and the Lambe was a Type of his death, and the manner thereof in many things, as I inſtanced in before. Yet was the Paſchall Lambe a figure alſo of the ſacred Euchariſt: <hi>Magis immediatè, &amp; principaliter ceremonia agni paſchalis fuit figura Eucharistiae, quam Paſſionis,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Bellarmine de miſſa.</hi> 1.7.) The Ceremony of the Paſchall Lambe was more immediately, and more principally the figure of the bleſſed Euchariſt, than of Chriſts Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Hierome</hi> on <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. and upon thoſe words, <hi>verſ.</hi> 26. commenteth thus: <hi>Poſtquam Typicum paſcha fuit impletum, &amp; Agni carnes cum Apostolis comede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat,—ad verum Paſchae tranſgreditur Sacramentum:</hi> After that the Typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Paſſeover was fulfilled, and <hi>(Chriſt)</hi> had eaten the fleſh of the Lambe with his Apoſtles, he paſſeth over to the True Sacrament of the Paſſeover.</p>

Who can quell ſo fierce raging wilde motions of concupiſcence? who can beare the itchings, bitings, or akings of this wound? Beleeve, Gods grace is ſufficient for men. And that ye may be ſecure (ſaith Saint <hi>Bernard</hi>) you have the inveſtiture, that is, a new acquiſt and poſſeſſion of the Sacrament of the body and blood of Chriſt. For that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament worketh two things in us. <hi>Et ſenſum minuit in minimis, &amp; ingravioribus peccatis tollit omnino conſenſum:</hi> it infeebleth and diminiſheth ſin in the ſmalleſt matters, but in more grievous ſins it wholly taketh away our conſent.</p>

                        <p>A Third Reaſon for its Inſtitution, was, to prefigure Chriſts death, and going out of the world. <hi>John</hi> 13.1. <hi>Jeſus knew his houre was come, that he ſhould depart out of the world unto the Father;</hi>

<pb n="544" facs="tcp:47497:202"/>And they did alſo finally deſigne and typifie Chriſts death. Therefore the bleſſed Euchariſt muſt needs adumbrate Chriſts death alſo. Indeed the Egyptian Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, by the ſprinkling of whoſe blood the Iſraelites were freed from the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating Angel, doth moſt lively typifie Chriſt ſlaine, and his blood delivering us. But the Paſchal Lamb, which afterward was yeerely ſlaine, did more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the Sacrament of Chriſts body and blood: and yet both the firſt, and the ſucceding yeerely Paſſeover, may all of them, and each of them, in a true and fitting ſence, be ſaid to prefigure, not only the Sacrament of the body and blood of Chriſt, but the very Crucifixion of our bleſſed Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

                        <p>A Fourth Cauſe of Chriſt's ſuperinducing of the bleſſed Euchariſt was, to be a remembrance to us of Chriſts death till he commeth againe: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24. <hi>Doe this in remembrance of me:</hi> ſo verſe 25. <hi>As often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye doo ſhew the Lords death till he come,</hi> ver. 26.</p>
                        <p>The Paſchall was a memoriall of their deliverance from Egypt, and of their paſſing the Red-ſea, without danger, whilſt the Sea ſtood, as two Chriſtall walls, <hi>on the right hand, and the left,</hi> and they paſſed through dry-footed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.22. Againe, when in after times their children were to ask, <hi>What mean you by this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice? Ye ſhall ſay, It is the Sacrifice of the Lords Paſſeover, who paſſed over the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the children of Iſrael in Egypt, when he ſmote the Egyptians, and delivere dour houſes, Exod.</hi> 12.26. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But the Euchariſt is a memoriall of our deliverance from Sin, Hell, and the power of Satan. Therefore ſo farre as ſpirituall deliverances are above temporall, as the ſoules are above the bodies, heaven above earth; ſo farre doth our holy Euchariſt antecede their Paſchal, and bringeth with it more certaine fruit, and fuller Grace infuſed; not only Sealing and Signifying Grace, but Conferring and Exhibiting it by it ſelfe in the true uſe.</p>
                        <p>I urge not this effect ſo farre, as to exclude Baptiſme from working remiſſion of ſinnes; nor as if the ſacred Suchariſt did remit the Same Individuall ſinnes which were Before remitted by Baptiſme, or as if it did remit ſins that never were Repented of. God doth not ſo much. But the Sacrament of the body and blood of our Lord forgiveth ſuch ſins as have beene committed betweene the receiving of Baptiſme, and it; and ſuch ſins as have overborne us, ſince our hearty Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Repentance: yea, where ſins are perfectly forgiven before the holy Communion; yet doth the Holy Communion Enſeale and Ratifie the former remiſſion (if I may ſo ſpeake) and the Euchariſt (in the right uſe) maketh an Attrite man, a Contrite One; A Contrite man, to be Juſtified; A Juſtified man, to be Holy; An Holy man, to be More holy; and the Holieſt One, to be more lively, ſpiritfull, and prompt in religious ſervices, than (I think) he would have beene, if the Sacrament had beene omitted.</p>
                        <p>Thus I doubt not but if the Thrice-bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> had received the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated Euchariſt (as in likelihood ſhe did) though ſhe were full of Grace, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Angels ſalutation, when ſhe received it; yet it would not have beene uneffectuall to her Good: for ſhe was not ſo full of Grace, but that ſhee was ſtill capable of more and greater additaments of Grace.</p>
                        <p>Many more Reaſons there are, why Chriſt Jeſus did ſuperinſtitute the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Euchariſt, deſtroying and aboliſhing thereby the old Paſſeover. I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance only in ſome of them: and that very briefly.</p>

                        <p>A Fifth Reaſon why Chriſt did inſtitute this Sacrament, was, to unite us to Himſelfe, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 10.16. <hi>The cup of bleſſing, which wee bleſſe,
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:47497:202"/>is it not the Communion of the blood of Chriſt? The bread, which we breake, is it not the Communion of the body of Chriſt?</hi> The cup is ſo neceſſary, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle placeth it before the bread.</p>

                        <p n="8">8. To further our ſpirituall Life. And therefore it is not only ſet down nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively. <hi>John</hi> 6.53. <hi>Except ye eat the fleſh of the Son of Man, and drink his blood ye have no life in you:</hi> but it is further poſitively averred, <hi>I am that bread of Life, ver.</hi> 48. <hi>and ver.</hi> 50. <hi>This is that bread which commeth downe from Heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not dye.</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 51. <hi>I am the living bread.—The bread that I will give, is my fleſh, which I will give for the Life of the World.</hi> And moſt apparently in the 54. <hi>ver. who ſo eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my blood, hath aeternall Life.

When Chriſt had loved his unto the end, becauſe all the reſt did not ſuffice to perfect Charity, unleſſe he gave himſelfe for all, of which the Euchariſt was the wonderfull myſtery: <hi>Recipit ſe in manus ſuas, &amp; in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramento fregit, &amp; diſtribuit:</hi> He taketh himſelfe into his own hands, and in the Sacrament brake and diſtributed himſelfe. Like as if bread were alive, and ſhould break and diſtribute it ſelfe, that they might live, to whom it was diſtributed; and it ſelfe ſhould dye by being diſtributed; So Chriſt gave himſelfe to us, as if he did ſo diſtribute himſelfe to us by dying,<note place="margin">Nota.</note> that he might give life unto us. In the ſame place he calleth it the Sacrament of Filiation, all doubt being taken away concerning the Filiation of God.

The reaſon why the Salt-ſea ſendeth forth freſh fiſh. New Inventions are to be admired. Many things may be perfected, which yet ſeeme Incredible. Gunpowder may be made of River-water. The Turkes have found it. Of oyle diſtilling from Alume-hills: the Spaniards have practiſed it. Why not of our Bath waters?

The beſt Loadſtones in the Eaſt Indies, in China and Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gala. The art of flying thought poſſible by <hi>Campanella.</hi> The man in the Moone added much to this Invention.

Where evident Scripture faileth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſtrong Preſumptions, or Tradition, or Reaſon may carry it. Truth (ſaid <hi>Democritus</hi>) is hid in a deep well. Matters of Faith are not to be grounded upon the bare opinions of men. The Church not bound to doe many things which Chriſt did, eſpecially in circumſtance of time. They who deferre Baptiſme till thirty yeeres of their age (as Chriſt did) are taxed. Chriſt had many reaſons ſo to doe. Chriſts Adminiſtration of the Euchariſt a Patterne not for the Circumſtance, but for the Subſtantiall forme thereof. Divers Circumſtances wherein we differ from Chriſt in Adminiſtring the bleſſed Euchariſt. Altars in Scripture ſometimes called Tables; Tables ſometimes termed Altars.</p>

                        <p>Well then, this being preſuppoſed, that <hi>Iudas</hi> was firſt removed; Let us now in the firſt place, (according to my propounded Method) examine, After what words Chriſt began his Third and Laſt Supper.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Tatianus Alexandrinus</hi> in his Harmony, thinkes Chriſt began to inſtitute the Euchariſt when <hi>Iudas</hi> was gone out, After thoſe words, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.32. <hi>God ſhall alſo glorifie him in himſelfe, and ſhall ſtraightway glorifie him.</hi> This ſeemes the more probable, becauſe, when <hi>Iudas</hi> was gone out, Jeſus ſaid, <hi>Now is the Sonne of man glorified, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Jeſuit <hi>Barradius,</hi> is of the ſame opinion. Yet I hold it more probable, that Chriſt did inſtitute his bleſſed Euchariſt ſo ſoone as <hi>Iudas</hi> went out. And it may be, for that cauſe chiefly, if not onely, Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Iudas, That thou doest, doe quickly,</hi> verſ. 27. becauſe he would not have <hi>Iudas,</hi> who was a devill, to partake of that heavenly banquet. And then the intire diſcourſe continuing from <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.31. and ſo forward, immediately followed, After the receiving of the divine Euchariſt with the bleſſed Apoſtles, when the Traytor was gone. For though it be ſaid, when <hi>Iudas</hi> was gone out, Jeſus ſaid this, and this; yet it is not ſaid, Jeſus immediately ſaid this, When <hi>Iudas</hi> was gone out. And it doth not exclude, but ſome thing might intercede: and that muſt then be the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt. For the word <hi>(When)</hi> doth not alwaies note the Immediation of times, or things conſequent, but fairely admitteth, that ſuch, and ſuch words may be ſaid; ſuch, and ſuch works may be done, in a competent diſtance.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Dub.</hi> Yea, but why did S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> mention no ſuch matter, nor the holy Third Supper of the Lord, nor the Euchariſt, nor name the Sacrament, of which himſelfe was partaker?</p>

                        <p>BEſides for ought that any man knoweth; the 31. verſe of the 13. of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> might be the beginning of a new Chapter, Long ſince.</p>
                        <p>For neither Evangeliſts, nor Apoſtles, divided their Writings by Chapters, and Verſes; nor did our Saviour, nor any of his Apoſtles, in any of their cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of points from the old Teſtament, punctually inſiſt on Chapter, Verſe, or fixt number of the Pſalmes.</p>
                        <p>Indeed it is probable, that the Books of the old Teſtament were from the firſt divided, and diſtinguiſhed, as now they are, by their ſeverall names: as <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, Exodus,</hi> and the like: and that they began and ended, as now they doe.</p>
                        <p>Yet I want proofe to ſay, They were at firſt ſo divided into Chapters &amp; Verſes.</p>
                        <p>The Jewes of old time, divided the Pentateuch, or the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the firſt five Bookes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> into Fifty foure Sections: you may better call them Readings, or Lectures, if you pleaſe. Of theſe Lectures, ſome were greater, or longer; others, ſhorter, and leſſe. <hi>Heinſius</hi> mentioneth that among the Hebrews, there was <hi>Major &amp; Minor paraſcha;</hi> the greater and the leſſer diſtinction.</p>
                        <p>Another diſtinction is obſerved by skilfull Hebritians, When the Section is not ſo full and abſolute, they phraſe it a <hi>Paraſhah,</hi> or Diſtinction: and this in the Hebrew is ſignified by the prefixing of three <hi>P. P. P.</hi> But when the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is more compleate, it is called or ſtiled <hi>Seder,</hi> an Order: and it is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the former, by the trebled letter of <hi>S. S. S.</hi> And they were All read, once a yeare, in the Jewiſh Synagogues. Yet becauſe there were but Fifty two Sabbaths, and Fifty foure Readings; twice in a yeare, they conjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned two of the ſhorteſt Sections together: and ſo all were exactly and intirely read over, within the compaſſe of one yeare. The Fifty ſecond Section is a very ſhort one; and ſo are diverſe of the later Sections.</p>

                        <p>I might proceed to other their Readings, out of the ſix Books of the Pſalmes, as the Jews divided them, though the holy Spirit by S. <hi>Peter</hi> calleth it in the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar number, <hi>The Book of the Pſalmes, Acts</hi> 1 20. having reference to the firſt compoſure, and united body of them.</p>
                        <p>And out of the Prophets, they had another diſtinct Reading, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.15. After the reading of the Law and the Prophets, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.27. <hi>The Rulers knew not Chriſt, nor yet the voyces of the Prophets,</hi> which are read every Sabbath day.

                        <p>The Jews deliver traditionally that every of the Lectures of the Law, or <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateuch</hi> conſiſted of one hundred thirty ſixe verſes. And when <hi>Antiochus</hi> had rent the Books of the Law in pieces, which they found, and (to make ſure work as he imagined) burnt them alſo with fire: (and this, the inſtruments of <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> did monethly: 1 <hi>Macchab.</hi> 1.56, &amp; 58. verſes:) To ſupply this, the Jews (ſaith <hi>Lapide</hi>) took as many verſes agreeing in ſenſe with the former, out of the Prophets, and ſo read them united in the room of the other; and wee may not think any one verſe hath periſhed, much leſſe, ſo great variety. The Jews ſay confidently, that the Lord God more regardeth, and reſpecteth every ſyllable, and letter of the Law, than he doth the Stars of Heaven.</p>

                        <p>Firſt, againſt the malevolent, maledicent, recalcitrating, ignorant Puritans, who reprove our Church for mangling, and cutting in pieces the Word of God: becauſe we read in our Service one piece of one Chapter and another piece of another; and ſo patch up a Leſſon, as they terme it.</p>

I anſwer, In many of theſe Lectures of the Law, Gods choſen people did do ſo, as appeareth in their very firſt Lecture, which ended at <hi>Geneſis</hi> 6 8. and their ſecond Lecture began not at a new whole Chapter, but at <hi>Geneſis</hi> 6.9. verſe. And the like is in diverſe other Readings, as by the diviſions plainely appeareth. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if our Church (led by ſuch a Preſident, and by that, which is to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before any humane preſident, Wel-grounded Reaſons) doth ſometimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin toward the middle of one chapter, and end toward the midle of another cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter, it is not to bee diſallowed. Wee aremore to be guided by matter, than by Numbers. And if any new matter of moment do occurre, (as often it doth) about the midſt of a chapter, this new notable emergent point (whereſoever ariſing) may wel begin a Leſſon appropriat for that time, and occaſion: as the Sun-ſhine al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways appeareth moſt welcome from what part of Heaven ſoever it breaketh from under a cloud.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, as I hold it moſt certaine, that the names of the Books Divine, were called even from their very beginnings, as now they are, <hi>Geneſis Exodus,</hi> and the like: So I have not ſeene it proved, that at the firſt the books were divided by Chapters; or the Chapters by Verſes. Sure I am, whereſoever the holy Spirit of God, in the New Teſtament pointeth at, or citeth any paſſage from the Old Teſtament; though the Prophet be named, or the Law (that is, one Book of the <hi>Pentaeteuch</hi>) be mentioned: or the Book of Pſalmes be particularly expreſſed: yet never in any one of all theſe places, is the chapter, much leſſe the verſe ſpeciali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. Neither was there any need in thoſe dayes. For the Jews got by heart, as we ſay, all the Old Teſtament: and upon the leaſt intimation, or inckling of any matter, they as readily could recite it, as many of us can the Lords Prayer, or the <hi>Ten Commandements.</hi>

Wherefore I humbly deſire all, both of the Clergy and Laity, to prevent that odious, rammiſh, and ſtincking cuſtome, and now to Iudaiſe in This point, and to follow Gods owne Precept, when he gave this Law to the Iewes, <hi>Deuterono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> 23.12. <hi>Thou ſhalt have a place alſo without the Campe, whither thou ſhalt goe forth abroad.</hi> And verſ. 13. <hi>Thou ſhalt have a paddle upon thy weapon,</hi> (or a ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaffe, as is uſually called with us) <hi>and it ſhall be, when thou ſhalt eaſe thy ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, that thou ſhalt dig therewith, and ſhalt turne back, and cover that which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from thee.</hi> Obſerve; The eaſing of their bodies was not to be done, no not in the Campe: much leſſe neare the Sanctuary: leaſt of all In it, or About it. Yet have the enemies to our Church, emptied and eaſed their bodies of filth, and filled their ſoules with ſinne, by defiling that fayre Cathedrall, even to the great ſcandall of the paſſers-by. Againe, even without the Campe, they muſt not leave their Ordure Above ground (as they doe in too many places both of the Cloſe, and Citie, and in other Townes and Villages, but eſpecially the greateſt Cities) but firſt with their paddle-ſtaffe they digged a place, or an hole ſo big, that they might bury their filth therein. <hi>Thou ſhalt turne backe;</hi> Though it be noyſome, and though thou wouldeſt fly from the uggly ſight; yet to prevent a greater harme, thou ſhalt looke on thine owne corruption, and ſhalt cover that which commeth from thee, leaſt it be noyſome to others, when thou art gone.</p>
                        <p>The earth is beſt manured when ſuch filth is covered; the lying of it open may ingender infection. Goe to the Cat, ye filthy Ones, and behold her wayes: ſhee ſeekes a ſecret place to unloade her ſelfe: and when ſhee hath done, hideth, and covereth her naturall uncleanneſſe; as aſhamed of that which our beaſtly Stinckards lay open to infect the ayre.</p>
                        <p>Examine the Birds of the ayre, and they will tell thee; They defile not their neſts, nor let their excrements lie to be offenſive. Wilt thou, who deſireſt to be like Angels in obedience, ſaying daily, <hi>Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven;</hi> be worſe than Birds or Beaſts in civility, and cleanlineſſe?</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, conſider the reaſons annexed, and they are of great conſequence. <hi>For the Lord thy God walketh in the midst of thy campe: to deliver thee, and to give up thine enemies before thee: Therefore ſhall thy campe be Holy, that he ſee no uncleane thing in thee, and turne away from thee.</hi> Deuteronomy, 23.14. Did God walke in the midſt of their Campe? and walkes he not in the midſt of our Temples? Are not with us <hi>Angeliorationis aſtantes,</hi> Angels that are preſent, and heare our prayers? that I may ſpeake in <hi>Tertullians</hi> phraſe: In regard of which divine preſences, we are bound in conſcience, when we goe to Church, to prepare our ſelves, as if we were climbing into heaven, to converſe with God, and his holy Angels: God is there to deliver us from Sinne, Satan, and the World, worſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies by farre than the Iſraelites had any. There God walketh, not onely to give up our enemies before us, but <hi>to tread downe Satan under our feet,</hi> or bruiſe him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.20.</p>

                        <p>Neither let any man ſay. This was a Iudiciall or Ceremoniall Law. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed reaſon of equity, and avoyding of inconvenience, may plead for the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance. But it was ordeined onely in their journyings. I anſwere; Had God more care of their handſomneſſe, and cleanlineſſe in their encampings, where they reſted one night, and departed in the morning, than he had of their cleanly behaviour in their Cities, and ſettled habitations? It is not denied, but after they were fixed in Villages, Townes, and Cities, yet when their Armies were in which they might moſt conveniently obſerve, and performe in their back-ſides, gardens, hortyards, and other by-places? <hi>Joſephus de Bello Iudaico,</hi> 2.7. relateth, of that moſt ſtrict, and religious Order of their <hi>Eſſeni,</hi> that they, even in <hi>Iudaea,</hi> were diligent obſervers of the Law in this point.</p>

                           <hi>Therefore ſhall thy Campe be Holy:</hi> And in theſe words, Cleanneſſe is held to be a kinde of Holineſſe; as the neare good houſewife holds cleanlineſſe to be a vertue. <hi>That God may ſee no uncleane thing in Thee;</hi> no faedity, no uncheanneſſe in Thee. The uncleanneſſe within the Campe, is an uncleanneſſe within them. The Sun-beames are not defiled with looking on ſuch filth: much leſſe is the moſt pure eye of the Lord offended at it, in regard of himſelfe: but God reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the health of man, exacteth cleanlineſſe, and ſweetneſſe from him, as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervatives thereof, and inhibiteth ſtincking naſtineſſe, as the ingenderer of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and poyſon of the good ſpirits.</p>
                        <p>Further, the ſight of any one uncleane thing, may make the Lord turne away from thee.

                        <p>The Chaldee thus, <hi>Non eſt locus communis, ſed locus in quo beneplacitum eſt coram deo:</hi> This is no common place, but a place wherein God is well pleaſed. Let thoſe ſuffer according to their deſervings, who pollute the places conſecrated to God.</p>
                        <p>That there is a great difference betweene ſeverall grounds, ſome more holy than others, is apparent: <hi>Exodus</hi> 3.5. Where God ſaid to <hi>Moſes, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy ſhooes from thy feet: for the place whereon thou ſtandeſt, is holy ground.</hi> No not <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelfe, though a very holy man: No not <hi>Joſhuah</hi> his ſucceſſor, whom the Captain of the Lords Hoſt commanded, <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 5.15. <hi>Looſe thy ſhooes from off thy feet: for the place whereon thou ſtandeſt, is holy:</hi> and <hi>Ioſhuah</hi> did ſo. Might not ſuch holy and heavenly men weare ſo much as their ſhooes, becauſe the ground was ſacred: And ſhall prophane wretches ſqueeze out their filth in places Conſecrated? <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Ioſhuah</hi> knew not at firſt that the ground
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:47497:208"/>was Holy: but the beaſtly ones with us doe know that the Churchyard hath beene ſeperated and ſingled from prophane abuſe. The more is their ſinne.</p>

                        <p>ANother errour of theſe times is this: (I wiſh it were not (in ſome people) more than an errour) that after Sermons ended, the giddy people flock toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and under the ſpecious title of Repetition (forſooth) they repeat only their vanity. They doe indeed keep Conventicles contrary to the Law; ſtow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the houſe of one of the moſt furious Zelotes, make long prayers, filled up with their profeſſed Repetitions; cenſure, raile, miſ-expound Scriptures, propound
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:47497:209"/>fooliſh and curious queſtions, and receive back ridiculous anſwers; gather up ſummes of money to uphold faction, and to animate the obſtinate Ones; breed up youth to boldneſſe, fierceneſſe, ſelfe-conceipt; and to ſwallow downe a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of their owne ſalvation. Then they proceed to declare Who ſhall bee ſaved, Who ſhall be damned (which is more than Men or Angels, good or bad doe know till toward death.) What ſcandalls have beene offered, what ſins, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Cloke, committed, every great Towne knoweth; and every Chriſtian heart lamenteth that knoweth this.</p>
                        <p>But I would fain learn of theſe falſe Breehren, or their falſe guides, Where ever, ſince the beginning of the world, or by Whom Such Conventicles were practiſed, by any of Gods people, unleſſe it were in the dayes of perſecution, or where the Churches were ſhut up from the true ſervice of God. When Satan was let looſe, when the raging ſword was drunk with blood, we read <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.37. <hi>&amp;c. They wandred about in ſheep-skins and goat-skins, being deſtitute, afflicted, tormented: Of whom the world was not worthy; They wandred in deſerts, and in mountaines, and in dens, and caves of the earth.</hi> This did they doe alſo after S. <hi>Pauls</hi> death, during the Ten great Perſecutions. But never was there heard of one Conventicle of Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Chriſtians, when religious Princes favoured the Church (as Gods holy Name be bleſſed they doe, and long time may they proſper) and whilſt the Goſpel flouriſhed (as theſe thouſand yeeres it never proſpered more.) And will our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be wiſer than all that ever went before them? or dare their profane mouthes accuſe our moſt ſacred and holy King, as an enemy to the true Profeſſours, and doctrine of Chriſt? than whom (God be bleſſed) we never had a more religious, favourable, gratious, temperate, chaſte, and ſanctified Prince, ſince England em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced Chriſtianity.</p>
                        <p>Rather than they ſhould miſ-ſpend their time in their own will-worſhip, edifie unto evill, give ſcandalls to the Church, call themſelves weak brethren, whilſt they think themſelves the moſt learned Doctors, and devouteſt part of Gods mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant Church: I could wiſh them each in their private houſes (if our Liturgy and Church Service be not ſavory enough, that is, not long enough for them) to do as the Iewes did. As they on their Sabbaths had a long Lecture, or Lectures every Sabbath day, one of which you may ſee before: ſo let theſe on the Lords day, or each day of the Lord, when our Church Service is ended, reade the ſame Lecture, or Lectures, and another (if they pleaſe) out of the New Teſtament. Let them reade, with hearty precedent prayes unto God for a bleſſing; Reade, not to prate, and to diſpute, but to practiſe holy duties: Let them remember <hi>Pſalme</hi> 25.9. <hi>The meek will God guide in judgment: to the meek will he teach his way.</hi> Let them be aſſured, Saving knowledge goeth up and downe our ſtreets, and there is none of yeeres of diſcretion but knoweth enough to be ſaved, <hi>even Jeſus Chriſt, and him crucified.</hi> There remaineth nothing but that each man labour to be <hi>Christiformis,</hi> and, as farre as our weakneſſe will permit, to imitate Chriſt in holineſſe of life, and to be conformable to him here, in lowlineſſe of minde, that he may perfect us hereafter.</p>
                        <p>Oh, but the people judge, and ſay, It ſtandeth with Reaſon to ſerve God more than the Magiſtrate appointeth; and whatſoever is reaſonable, may paſſe for a Law. For <hi>Tertul, de corona militis cap.</hi> 3. ſaith, if the Law conſiſt of reaſon, then every thing, by whomſoever brought forth, which partaketh of reaſon, ſhall be a Law. But ſay I, <hi>Tertullian</hi> here fell ſhort of the truth. For the cauſe why Lawes are in force, is, not only becauſe they accord with Reaſon (though no Law ought to be unreaſonable) but becauſe the Lawes are made by ſuch as have authority to make Lawes; and it openeth too great a window unto licentiouſneſſe, that every thing ſhall be held a Law, which every one thinks is conſonant to Reaſon. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obſerve this diſtinction. If any man, whoſoever, findeth any Rule, running along with Reaſon and Religion, if it be not croſſed by his ſuperiours, let that be, if he will, a Law to him; let him be guided by it, till he finde a better Rule, or be
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:47497:209"/>taught otherwiſe by Authority. But a Generall Rule it muſt not be, till he who hath a Law-making power, doe ſtamp it with the approbation of publicke autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Order commandeth a ſubjection of the Inferior to the Superior. Order is <hi>relucentia ſapientiae,</hi> a bright ſhining ray of wiſedome; and participateth of the light of wiſedome (ſaith <hi>Cuſanus de venatione ſapieutiae cap.</hi> 31.) Let Gods people beware of will-worſhip, though gilded with religious pretences. Let them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what <hi>Calvin</hi> in his Epiſtles ſaith: When men deſire to worſhip God as themſelves pleaſe, whatſoever they averre of their owne, is a ſtincking propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. And ſtill (I ſay) <hi>Neſutor ultra crepidam;</hi> A Cobler muſt not go beyond his Laſt.

                        <p>Here let me ſay ſomewhat concerning the New Teſtament, and its diviſion by the Ancients differing from what is now.</p>
                        <p>The learned <hi>Caeſarius,</hi> brother to Saint <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> in his Queſtions ſaith, we have foure Goſpels, which conſiſt of eleven hundred ſixty two Chapters.</p>

And that the Syrian Tranſlator yet differed from all, as dividing one chapter into ſoure chapters; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, or the ſecond chapter, into three chapters.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Nonnus</hi> obſerveth not our chapters, much leſſe verſes. <hi>Suidas</hi> doth otherwiſe diſtinguiſh the chapters. <hi>Cyrill</hi> maketh twelve bookes on Saint <hi>John,</hi> as if all were concluded in twelve chapters.

                        <p>Let me adde ſomewhat more. The Arabick Tranſlator is much different from all others. <hi>Francis Junius</hi> in his preface before the Arabick tranſlation of the <hi>Acts, Arabs noſter capita (nec ſine judicio) aliter planè diſtinguit, atque in libris noſtris diſtincta ſunt: &amp; conſimiliter verſus alios dividit in noſtris confuſos.

<pb n="560" facs="tcp:47497:210"/>cauſe, or reaſon, the chapters otherwiſe than they are diſtinguiſhed in our bookes. Likewiſe concerning the verſes, he divided ſome, which are confounded together in our bookes; and joyneth others together, which were diſparate, and ſundred. And by this his Compoſition, that which was more obſcure, he iluſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and illuminateth as by a conjunction of ſtars.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Heinſius</hi> in the fore-cited place concurreth with <hi>unius,</hi> that ſome others diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are better than thoſe which we now have in uſe (in ſome things.) His words are; <hi>Intelligimus eos nonnunquam meliùs, quae non haererent, diviſiſſe:</hi> where ſome chapters or verſes had little dependance one upon another, they ſometimes better diſtinguiſhed them than we doe now I anſwer, if in ſome few of their variati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they come neerer to conveniency than ours doe (which I will not wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;) yet, if I have any judgement, they have ſtrayed worſe than the Greek di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions have done in other places, whileſt they ſtrive to be menders, that ought to be but Tranſlators. Indeed, if Saint <hi>Mark</hi> had delivered the Goſpell to the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians (as themſelves ſay he did;) and if their diſtinguiſhments be now ſuch as Saint <hi>Mark</hi> left them, it would make much for their authority. Or if any of thoſe Arabians <hi>Acts</hi> 2.11. who were at Jeruſalem at Pentecoſt, had in the dayes of the Apoſtles tranſlated the Goſpels, and kept them ſince from alteration, we might aſcribe much to it. But concerning the Syriack tranſlation; <hi>Non deſunt etiam quaedam in ea editione quae viris doctis &amp; piis non admodum placent:</hi> There are ſomethings in that edition which holy and learned men are not well pleaſed with, ſaith <hi>Bellarmine.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And I cannot eaſily be brought to beleeve, that S. <hi>Mark</hi> delivered to the Churches of Syria and Egypt, the Syriac edition of the New Teſtament; ſince neither <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> nor that living Library <hi>Origen</hi> (who laboured more about the Editions, than ever any other did.) Nor <hi>Euſebius,</hi> nor <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> nor <hi>Dydimus,</hi> nor <hi>Theophilus,</hi> nor <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> nor <hi>Hierom,</hi> nor <hi>Cyril,</hi> nor <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret,</hi> nor other Fathers, who were Biſhops or Prieſts in Syria, or Egypt, ſince none of theſe Fathers, who lived there, mentioned any ſuch Edition, or Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it ſhall paſſe with me, as a work of later times.</p>
                        <p>The ſame Arabick tranſlator maketh fifty chapters of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles; whereas we have only 28. chapters.</p>
                        <p>The firſt Epiſtle of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the Corinthians in the Arabick hath 21. chapters, having only 16. chapters with us.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond Epiſtle hath only 12. chapters in the Arabick, and yet we have 13. chapters in the Greek.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ammonius</hi> divided every one of the foure. Evangeliſts into many chapters: S. <hi>Matthew</hi> into 355 chapters. S. <hi>Marke</hi> into 135 chapters. S. <hi>Luke</hi> into 344 chapters. S. <hi>John</hi> into 232 chapters. So <hi>Sixtus Senenſis Bibliothecae ſanctae, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 160. relateth.</p>
                        <p>If ſuch difference be in chapters, which is the mainer diviſion; there muſt needs be more variant diverſity in the verſes; which are the ſubalternate diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences depending on the chapters. Much more might be ſaid, but I have wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred too long: and returne to what I handled before; namely, That we have no reaſon of neceſſity, to expect, that Chriſts adminiſtring of his Third and Laſt Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſhould be diſtinguiſhed by the beginning of a new chapter. For it is not ſo in any other of the Three Evangeliſts.</p>
                        <p>Nor are the chapters, and verſes of Divine inſtitution, but ſervient to the Churches ordination, varying according to the opinions of diverſe ages, and in the opinion of <hi>Junius</hi> and <hi>Heinſius</hi> may be better than now they are. And yet there might be a new chapter in ancient times, when <hi>Judas</hi> went out; the old one ending, <hi>John</hi> 13.30. at theſe words, <hi>And it was night.</hi> For preſently thereupon, in all likelyhood, was the bleſſed Euchariſt adminiſtred; and the Evangeliſt S. <hi>John</hi> wholly omitted what the other Three Evangeliſts had ſo fully deſcribed: And a new chapter might begin, <hi>John</hi> 13.31. Or if not, a new matter; namely,
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:47497:210"/>our thrice bleſſed Saviour his holy, heavenly, laſt Sermon <hi>(Sermo Domini in coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naculo,)</hi> which the other Three Evangeliſts very briefly touched at: but S. <hi>John</hi> declareth at large, from <hi>John</hi> 13.31. to <hi>John</hi> 18.1. Foure whole chapters, and more, in a continued, and uninterrupted <hi>manifeſto,</hi> or declaration.</p>

                        <p>LAſtly, ſince it is apparant even to ſenſe, and rectified reaſon, that Chriſt mingled not his moſt ſacred Third Supper and holy Euchariſt with ordinary meats; but took it by it ſelfe; as a diſtinct Sacrament of the New Teſtament, and as a glorious teſtimony of the Law of Grace; there is no place, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, ſo likely to eſtabliſh our Saviours adminiſtration of it, as immediately up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Iudas</hi> his excommunication, and ſeceſſion. And when the holy adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was ended, to the joy of the Apoſtles, and to the glory of God; Our divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Saviour brake forth into this Jubilee, and exultation of joy; <hi>Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in him, viz.</hi> when his Fleſh and Blood were made a glorious Sacrament of the New Law; <hi>then Chriſt was glorified and God in Chriſt.</hi> How was Chriſt, at that inſtant, glorified above other times, if not by <hi>Iudas</hi> his departure, and Chriſt giving the holy Euchariſt to his holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles? Or where could it be given more commodiouſly?</p>
                        <p>As for the words, <hi>Edentibus ipſis,</hi> I have heretofore cleared them by good au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, that they are not to be taken ſtrictly, as if, whileſt meat was in their jawes, and whileſt their mouths were full, and their teeth champing, Chriſt gave them the Supper of the Lord; nor as if we were not to receive the hallowed food, but as we are eating of ſome other things: nor, as if it were eſſentiall to have a co-eating: No Chriſtian heart can think ſo. For it were an undervaluing of the Body and Blood of the Lord: and little, or no diſcerning of the Lords Body from other common meats: yea, indeed an horrid mingle-mangle. But the words are to be expounded at large. For <hi>Convivantibus ipſis,</hi> Before they had ended their Feaſting: Before that nightly Feſtivity was broken up: Before they went out of the <hi>Coenaculum,</hi> that Supping room, Chriſt adminiſtred the holy Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt.</p>

For this were a confounding of things ſacred with profane (ſaith he;) And that is altogether unrighteous (ſay I) I retort the ſame on <hi>Iacobus Salianus,</hi> the great Annaliſt of the Old Teſtament, who in his laſt Tome pag. 454. conjoyneth in a ſort, the waſhing of the Apoſtles feet, and the Inſtitution of the Euchariſt: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter both which (ſaith he) <hi>Secuta eſt Coenacommunis,</hi> Followed the Second Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. He forgot that after the <hi>pedi-lavium,</hi> or waſhing of the Apoſtles feet, Chriſt ſate down again: and gave <hi>Iudas</hi> a Sop, which was in the Second Supper: and diſcourſed, and marked out <hi>Iudas</hi> for the Traytor: whereupon he departed: and then Chriſt took, and gave the bleſſed Sacrament, and did not take another Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per after it.</p>
                        <p>In the Eaſterne Churches there was a Traverſe drawn between the people, who were imployed in praying, and hearing: and thoſe Prieſts or Deacons, which were preparing. And whilſt they were preparing the bread and wine for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, when all was in a readineſſe, they drew the vayle, folded up the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines: the Prieſt did conſecrate the heavenly Euchariſt: did receive it himſelfe: did give it to the people: One cryed <hi>Surſum corda;</hi> Lift up your hearts: And the ſodaine ruſhing open of the Traverſe, at the beginning of the ſacred celebrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was to ſtrike Reverence into them.</p>

Oh how divine Concluſions did ſome Heathen draw from that ſmall knowledge, which they had! <hi>Plato</hi> in his Booke called <hi>Alcibiades Secundus:</hi> Or, <hi>de Voto;</hi> ſet forth by <hi>Jodocus Badius Aſcentius,</hi> with <hi>Marſilius Ficinus</hi> his Arguments before many bookes, <hi>Folio</hi> 19. brings in <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> teaching his <hi>Alcibiades</hi> (for indeed (<hi>leanthes</hi> did commonly, and uſually ſay, That <hi>Socrates</hi> onely held <hi>Alcibiades</hi> by the Eares, and that <hi>Alcibiades</hi> ſtood in awe of <hi>Socrates</hi> above all others, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> hath it <hi>in Alcibiade</hi>) How to
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:47497:211"/>pray; or rather, How not to pray vainely, ſince folly was diſcernable in the prime prayers, and devotions of thoſe times. And thence <hi>Socrates</hi> collecteth, and concludeth thus. It is neceſſary to wait, or expect, till it may be learned, How we may behave our ſelves (as we ought) both to God and Man. <hi>Alcibiades</hi> roundly replieth; <hi>When will that be, ô Socrates? and who is that Teacher, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructor?</hi> For I would moſt willingly know, and acknowledge that Man, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he ſhall be. <hi>Socrates</hi> moſt divinely anſwereth, (if his words be weighed in the ballance of the Sanctuary) <hi>He is he, who hath a care of thee.</hi> And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; <hi>He wonderfully provideth for thee.</hi> Whether <hi>Plato</hi> learned theſe truths of the Aegyptian Prieſts, Or Jewiſh Doctors; Or whether he had them inſpired from God; Or whether from naturall Reaſon he collected, That good God would not leave his creatures in perpetuall darkneſſe, but would ſend One to teach them, to guide them, to reforme their ignorances, and inſtruct them in their duties to God and Man: ſince He is He, who hath a care of us, and in a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full manner watcheth over us, for our Good; I ſay, whence he had thoſe beames of the divine light, is hard to determine. I am ſure the Scripture faith, <hi>Eſay</hi> 54.13. unto the Church of the Gentiles. <hi>All thy Children ſhall be taught of the Lord.</hi> And <hi>Act.</hi> 3.22. <hi>A Prophet ſhall the Lord your God raiſe up unto you of your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren like unto Moſes; Him ſhall yee heare in All things, whatſoever he ſhall ſay unto you:</hi> and verſ. 26. <hi>God ſent Jeſus to bleſſe you, turning away every one of you from his iniquities.</hi> And in Heathen phraſe, <hi>Plato</hi> implyeth no leſſe. For <hi>Homer</hi> ſaid, that <hi>Minerva</hi> tooke away a cloud from <hi>Diomedes</hi> his eyes, that he might diſcerne God from Man. So ſaid <hi>Socrates</hi> to his <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> Darkneſſe muſt be removed from your eyes, which now blindfoldeth you: Then other things muſt be preſented to you, by which you may diſtinguiſh Good and Evill. For now you are unfit for ſuch matters; And ſaith not the Scripture, that <hi>the Spirit of the Lord ſent Chriſt to preach Recovering of ſight to the blinde,</hi> Luk. 4.18? <hi>And Chriſt is the true Light, who lightneth every man that commeth into the world,</hi> Joh. 1.9. <hi>Alcibiades</hi> hoping to learne better things than he had before, humbly profeſſeth: Let that great Teacher, Rabbi, or Inſtructor, remove from me, either that cloud (if he will) either the <hi>Feſtucam</hi> in mine eye, or the <hi>Trabem</hi> (if ſo he vouchſafe) or any other impediment (if he pleaſe.) For I am ready to omit nothing, what he ſhall command, whoſoever he ſhall be, ſo I may grow a Better man.—And we will offer our Crowne, and all other decent things then, when I ſhall know That day is come, and it will not be long ere it come by the will of the Gods. So <hi>Alcibiades.</hi> Me thinks, I heare him ſpeake like one of the Magi in the Eaſt, and profeſſe to doe, what they did, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.11. Or like the woman of Samaria, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.25. <hi>I know, That Meſſias commeth, who is called Chriſt; when he is come, he will teach us All things.</hi> If <hi>Plato</hi> had not thought of a Mediator God and Man; what needed that compariſon from <hi>Homer,</hi> to diſtinguiſh one from the other? If he had not knowne him to be God, <hi>Plato</hi> could not have writ, He hath a care of thee, and doth wonderfully provide for thee; and yet Shall come Hereafter, and muſt be Waited for. If he alſo had not thought him to be a Man, (who was to come,) he would never have aſcribed unto him ſuch offices, of a Teacher, a Reformer, an Inlightner. I think I ſhall not erre, if I ſay, <hi>Plato</hi> his thoughts accorded in ſubſtance with what <hi>Zacharias</hi> ſaid, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.74. &amp;c. And what holy <hi>Simeon,</hi> Luk. 2.32. and with what the Prophets prophecied of Chriſt. And this Digreſſion have I inſiſted upon, to ſhew, that Great doores hang on ſmall Hinges: and from a Little crany of light, momentuall matters may be found. That we are not to give over mining, though the veyne ſeeme to be ſhrunke, and ſhut up; and that we cannot come to the fulneſſe of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but by degrees: and that a ſmall degree muſt ſerve, and content us, when we can attaine to no more. That the Salt water of the Ocean may be made freſh, and wholſome, and nouriſhing, is apparant by that excellent liquor being in Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, at their firſt taking up: than which juice the art of the Cooke, or the
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:47497:212"/>Apothecary cannot make a compound of a more delicate taſte and relliſh, and more gratefull, and acceptable to the ſtomach. Whether Art can imitate Nature in this, or how farre it may proceed, let others of leſſe imployments ſearch. This I will ſay; If a way were found to correct the Salt water, to ſeparate, and remove the brackiſhneſſe from it, to reduce it to the taſte, and temper of freſh waters, it would be moſt uſefull, and profitable for navigation, and abundance of people might live, and doe well, which for want of it doe periſh. Some of our men have found the way of diſtillation good, as <hi>Purchaſe</hi> hath it in his Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, If you object, The liquor of the Oyſter to be ſalt: I reply, it is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaltiſh, ſeaſonably brackiſh, to ſharpen the ſtomach, every way inoffenſive. Againe; What ſay you to this? That the beſt of waters which riſe on high hills and fountaines, were once Salt waters; but by running thorough the veynes of the earth, become ſo ſweet, ſo refreſhing, ſo wholſome; And may not the perco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation by Art take its ground and example, from the power of Nature, as it were ſtrayning the Salt water in the earth, till it be purified, ſweet, and wholſome? Againe; doth not the Sunne, and divine powers, exhale up vapours, even out of the Salt Sea? <hi>Did not a little cloud out of the Sea like a mans hand, become rayne, a great rayne, that the heaven was blacke with clouds, and winde,</hi> 1 Kings 18.45? And will any man doubt, but theſe ſhowers of Rayne waters which fell, were as ſweet, freſh, and wholſome, as ours? Againe, I have heard that toward the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the Sea, is freſh water; if the bed of the Sea be very deepe. And I have read of a River or two which keepe their freſhneſſe, though they flow or run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the maine Ocean a great way: the waters being unmingled, and eaſily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhable by the freſhet.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his Problems, Section 23. Queſtion 30. acknowledgeth that the upper part of the Sea is more ſalt and more warme than the lower parts. And it is ſo alſo in Pits, or Wells of water, whoſe thinner, lighter, and ſweeter parts are exhaled up, or alembecked by the ayre, and the Sunne, whereby both moſt ſaltneſſe, yea, and heavineſſe it ſelfe, contrary to nature, floateth in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt ſuperficies of the water. And in the next queſtion he taketh as granted, that That part of the Sea, which is neerer the Land, is ſweeter than the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote parts of it. Therefore, where Nature maketh ſuch a diverſity, and ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and percolation; I doubt not, but Art may follow her, and extract much good out of this diſquiſition. Some have ſaid, that Clay well tempered, is very effectuall to addulce Salt waters. Yea, I have heard, that our Seamen have ſearched, and found by a braſen, iron, or wooden veſſell (with a cloſe and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy cover, which will ſhut of it ſelfe, but open with a vice, and deſcendeth natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally by its owne weight) that it being let downe empty, about three or foure fathoms into the Sea-water, and then and there the veſſell being opened, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Art, and filled, and ſhut againe, and by ropes drawne up, bringeth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it, and up with it, water uſefull, potable, and healthy: though not ſo perfectly freſh as our Rivers, or Springs: but ſomewhat reſembling the taſte of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor in the ſhell of the Oyſter, <hi>ſalſo-dulce,</hi> and wholſome.</p>
                        <p>What hath been invented, I know not certainly; but that Salt water may be made ſweet and wholſome, I doubt not. The meanes may be various to the ſame end.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe vaſt Cakes of Ice, you may call them little mountaines (if you pleaſe) which are ſeene floating in the Northren frozen parts, towards the Spring, are not above three or foure fathome thick. No cold can congeale, or condenſate deeper: Nor did ever Ice in deepe Rivers, or Seas, reach downe, and touch the earth: but other waters, ſome think, freſh waters did glide along betweene the ice and the ground; both by reaſon of ſprings, whirlpooles, and other ebullitions of waters, ariſing in the deeps from the veynes of the earth at the bottome of the Sea, or deepe Rivers; and by reaſon of the inflowings of thoſe many naturall
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:47497:212"/>Aquaeducts, which tumble from our mountaines, our freſhets, fountaines, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, which doe not preſently loſe their pleaſing taſte, and ſweet ſavour, but Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſa-like retaine it for a while.</p>
                        <p>Likewiſe, though we cannot deny, but the vertue of the Sunne pierceth ſarre deeper than foure fathomes, even to the bottome of the mineralls, and mines, and much below them, even perhaps to the center of the earth; yet his rarifying power, by which he exhaleth up ſtill the lighter and thinner water, and leaveth the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier, and ſalter parts in the Sea, is conteined within foure fathoms depth, from the upper ſuperficies of the Sea, that is, the Sunne hath work enough, to draw ſo much ſweet water, as to make the Sea ſalt for foure fathoms deepe.</p>
                        <p>There is an Iland a little from Hiſpaniola (the Spaniards call it Arethuſa) which hath a fountaine in it comming by ſecret paſſages under both Earth and Sea: and ariſeth in that Iland: For it bringeth with it the leafes of many trees which grow in Hiſpaniola, and not in that Iland. <hi>Oviedo</hi> mentioneth a little Iland called Navazza, halfe a league from which, are many rocks in the Sea, five foot deep, covered with water: out of which iſſueth, and ſhooteth up above the water of the Sea, a ſpout of freſh water, as great as a mans arme, that it may be received ſweet and good. This was ſeen by <hi>Stephano della Rocca,</hi> a man of good credit. See <hi>Purchaſe</hi> his Pilgrim, 9.14. The freſh waters below the deepe Sea, may be a partiary cauſe, that all the fiſhes of the Sea be freſh; none ſo much as ſaltiſh: For to thoſe ſweeter waters they can quickly deſcend: though the ſalt water affordeth them more prey, and more deſire to multiply; and perhaps more deſire to play therein. <hi>Thou-haſt formed Leviathan to play in the Sea, Pſal.</hi> 104.26. When fiſhes are dead, how little ſalt, in a ſhort time, ſalteth them, whom the whole Sea could not ſeaſon, or reduce to a relliſh of ſaltneſſe whilſt they lived.</p>
                        <p>New Inventions which are profitable, I admire: and the Inventors, I do adore. Certainly, many things may be perfected, which yet we will not beleeve. Who would have thought, that the River-water ſhould be the chiefe ingredient to make Gunpowder? The Turks have found it. Or, that Allum hills ſhould di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill a liquor like unto oyle, and ſulphur, or brimſtone, whereof the Spaniards make excellent Gunpowder: as <hi>Purchaſe</hi> relateth, <hi>pag.</hi> 16.6. Our brackiſh fountaines; our Bathes; our Brimſtony ſprings, or rivelets, may perhaps doe the like.</p>
                        <p>The Lake Mardotis, or Maraeotis, now called Buchira, (ſaith Maſter <hi>George Sandys</hi> in his Journey, <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>folio</hi> 112.) by the Citie of Alexandria, was by a narrow cut, joyned unto another Lake farre leſſe, and nearer the Sea; which at this day too plentifully furniſheth all Turky with Saltpeter. (ſaith <hi>Purchaſe</hi> in his Pilgrimes, part 2. chap. 8. parag. 1. fol. 900. from the ſaid Maſter <hi>G. San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys, loc. cit. fol.</hi> 113. <hi>&amp;</hi> 114.) Whereupon I could wiſh that the ſonnes of Art would make experiments in ſome of our Lakes, or Rivers, or Fountaines, which taſte of brimſtone, or are likely to yeeld ſuch effects, though meſſengers were ſent both to taſte of that Aegyptian Lake, and to ſee their manner of making Saltpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter there.</p>
                        <p>If there may not be more profit and benefit to mankinde, if this Invention were perfected, and in uſe, than by the wilde diſcoveries of the Man in the Moone; or the fancies of the Lord Verulam in the New Atlantis; or the Northren Iland all made of Loadſtones, found onely in the braines of <hi>Campanella De ſenſu re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> 1.8.

If therefore a man uſe fit meats, and get the agility of ſuch as walk on ropes, and procure wings like to Cranes, and knows how well to imitate them; if armes, thighes, and leggs be fitted with wings, he may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps fly. The Man in the Moone addeth much to this Invention; yet is but a Fable.</p>
                        <p>But that two Ships of equall both burthen and ſhape, one ſhould be yare of ſayling, becauſe he conſenteth to ſuch an end; and the other ſlow, and unfit for ſayling, becauſe it is more againſt it, and unwilling to conſent unto ſayling; I ſay, theſe are ſtrange formes of expreſſion uſed by <hi>Campanella,</hi> 3. <hi>in fine.</hi> As for the makers of Clocks, complaining of the ſame point, I ſay, the temper of mettalls is not ſo exact, but there may be ſome predominant purity in ſome part rather than in other.</p>

                           <hi>Gregory Naziazen Oratione in Sanctum Baptiſma,</hi> teacheth, That the Church is not bound to do divers things, which Chriſt did. Particularly, not in the circumſtance of Time: and he taxeth them, who deferred their Baptiſm, till the thirtieth yeare, becauſe Chriſt did ſo. Chriſt had many Reaſons, which we know not, moving him to do, as he did: which are no grounds for our proceedings.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the Deferring of his Baptiſm, He had theſe cauſes, which wee have not. He was circumcized on the eight day; we are not, and therefore wee do well to haſte to Baptiſm. He was ſo free both from Originall, and actuall ſin, that he needed not at all to be Baptized. But to inſtitute a Sacrament, and for our good, he was content to be Baptized by his ſervant <hi>John: Thus it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:47497:213"/>us to fulfill all righteouſneſſe</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to <hi>Iohn, Matth.</hi> 3.15.) So con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the bleſſed Sacrament of the Euchariſt.</p>
                        <p>All men, of all ſides, confeſſe, that Chriſt never intended, that His adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the bleſſed Sacrament of the Euchariſt ſhould bee a patterne for the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances thereof, but only for the ſubſtantiall forme of conſecration. He who will wholy conforme himſelfe to Chriſts actions; yet, ſhall fayle in many things now ingood uſe. Chriſt, and his Apoſtlestook the bleſſed Euchariſt after other meats. S. <hi>Paul</hi> changeth the order; and willeth the Corinthians to eat firſt at home. Chriſt tooke it with his, at Night. The Primative Church guided by the Apoſtles, and they by the Spirit (ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtine ad Januarium</hi>) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it to be taken in the Morning; and that Faſting. Chriſt received it in an upper Chamber: We in Churches. Chriſt did celebrate it only on Thurſday, and about ſeaven of the clock in the Night; But S. <hi>Paul</hi> conſecrated it on the firſt day of the week, and about Midnight, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We on any Day, or Houre. Chriſts Sermon in <hi>Coenaculo,</hi> was after the Communion; Ours, before it. Chriſt had only Men in the company: we both Men and Women. Chriſt communicated with Prieſts only: we with the Laity. Chriſt with himſelfe had only Twelve: we have Scores, and Hundreds. Chriſt on the Fourteenth day of the Firſt moneth: We may at all times. Chriſt adminiſtred it not on an Altar. (For what ſhould an Altar do in a private mans Gueſt chamber, or Feaſting room?) but on a Table. But the whole Church ſince the times of perſecution, uſed Altars, both names and things; and called thoſe Altars, Tables ſometimes: as <hi>Malachy</hi> did the Jewiſh Altars before them, <hi>Malachy</hi> 1.7. And ſometimes they tearmed their Tables Altars. So, at our firſt Reformation in <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixt, his Injunction the third, it is called both the high Altar before the Sacrament; and Injunction the 9. the bleſſed Sacrament of the Altar, and Gods boord; that we may learne not to ſet them ſo far at variance, as ſome have done; that we may not ſeek for knots in bulruſhes, or <hi>rixari de lanâ caprinâ,</hi> pick quarrels for ſtraws, or ſeek the Rayſing up of one, according to our fancy, by the deſtruction of the other. He conſecrated <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleavened bread;</hi> which we are not abſolutely bound to do. And whether he dranke pure wine, or water mingled with wine, he hath left us free. If that our bleſſed Saviours manner of conſecration, for the minuter circumſtances was to be our patterne only, why did S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſet ſome things in order, contrary to Chriſts manner of receiving? and promiſed he <hi>would ſet other things in order, when he came,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.34.

Biſhop <hi>Morton</hi> in his defence of the innocency of Three Coremonies of the Church of England, pag. 246. thus; what the expreſſe forme of Chriſts Geſture was, is left by the holy Evangeliſts in ſuch an uncertainty, that we may juſtly collect from thence, that Chriſt intended not to make his Geſtures to be an exact patterne of neceſſary i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation to be continued in his Church.</p>

                           </gap>. Which may be more largely interpreted, than thus, <hi>When Hee had Supped;</hi> as
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:47497:215"/>our laſt tranſlation hath it: even thus; <hi>After they all had Supped.</hi> Therefore it was not done in Supper time, or whilſt they were eating. And upon compariſon of thoſe foure places, tell me now, which ſtandeth with moſt reaſon, That hee gave the bleſſed Euchariſt, as they were chewing their meat; or that it was done after Supper? eſpecially, S. <hi>Paul</hi> writing laſt of them, and being taught of the Lord Jeſus himſelfe, the manner how it was adminiſtred. <hi>I received of the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.23. Again did Chriſt ſay, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.16. <hi>No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment: neither do men put new wine into old bottles:—but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preſerved:</hi> verſ. 17. And can wee think himſelfe would put the New ſanctifying food of Grace and of his Body and Blood, into thoſe mouths, which were eating, and feeding upon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon food of the Old Law, even as they were Eating? Or is it likely, Chriſt gave Thanks, whilſt they were Eating? But Thanks he gave, as many Greek copies have it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26 26. And this Thanks began the Euchariſt. Or conſecrated he the New Sacrament whilſt they were eating their Ordinary food? Chriſt bleſſed the bread ere he brake it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.26. Did they eat whilſt he was bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the bread? <hi>Ezechiel</hi> 44.23. <hi>The Priests ſhall teach my people the difference between the Holy and profane; and cauſe men to diſcerne between the uncleane and the cleane.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Wherefore let no man imagine that Chriſt would make a mingle-mangle of earthly and heavenly matters, of bodily and ſpirituall food; and give them his Sacred Body and Blood, As they were eating a Common Supper. <hi>Edentibus illis,</hi> may ſignifie <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>THirdly, it muſt be acknowledged, that whatſoever Geſture, or Poſture, our bleſſed Saviour had uſed, if it were certaine that he uſed it, it had been Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveable, Holy, and Divine. His exemplary beginning might juſtly give a forme to After times: And whatſoever he had done, had been admirably good.</p>

                           <hi>Ludolphus,</hi> without any good ground, ſaith, That Chriſt went with his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles into a Lower Chamber to waſh their feet: which hath not ſo much as a foot-ſtep, or ſhadow of reaſon. Nearer to the purpoſe.</p>

                           </gap> they Sate at ſupper on the earth as it were Lying, and Recumbing in the Furniſhed Room. Perhaps, <hi>Hugh Broughton</hi> from hence tooke his wild Iriſh opinion.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the diſcumbing of Chriſt with his Apoſtles, and their Tables, ſee what I have written <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Tricoenii, cap.</hi> 21. Let me adde my opinion (for all the world is full of opinions in ſo unexpreſſed a matter.) That they <hi>Sate</hi> not at the Sacred Supper, on Couches, or Carpets ſpread on the ground, or ſuch like things; though a very learned man, my honored old acquaintance <hi>(quem honoris causâ nomino)</hi> is a little too reſolute in the point. For it is not probable, much leſſe <hi>very probable,</hi> that our Saviour did inſtitute this Sacrament (of the bleſſed Euchariſt) <hi>potius ſupra Pavimentum, quàm ſupra Menſam;</hi> rather upon the Pavement, than upon a Table. For if he had inſtituted it <hi>Supra Pavimentum,</hi> upon the Pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yet had he inſtituted it alſo <hi>Supra Menſam,</hi> upon a Table: For the earth adorned with Carpets, or other furniture ſupplyed the room of Tables. <hi>Coenacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum ſtratum,</hi> A well prepared Chamber implyed more, than <hi>Menſam ſtratam,</hi> A ſpread Table; <hi>Menſa ſtrata,</hi> a Table ſpread, is involved <hi>in coenaculo ſtrato,</hi> in a well prepared chamber; not <hi>è contra.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Certainly in ſo dubious a point, I heartily could have wiſhed a more timerous kind of aſſertion. Chriſt (ſaith he) did adminiſter the ſame, not ſitting at a Table, but Lying on the floore on Couches. I anſwer: They never lay on the floore (at repaſt) but they had Tables alſo of one forme, or other, or ſpread Carpets inſtead of Tables; for that couches were on the floore, without any Tables, ſeemes ſtrange to me. It is impoſſible to prove this <hi>Negative;</hi> Chriſt adminiſtred the Euchariſt, not ſitting at a Table: or this <hi>Affirmative,</hi> he adminiſtred it Lying on the floore on Couches. Couches were above the floore; if not always, yet moſt an end. And the Tables and Couches were anſwerable in conveniency one to another, that there might be a delightfull and convenient repaſt with all poſſible eaſe.</p>
                        <p>But it is little eaſe (if you make triall) to lye on Couches above ground, and to ſtoop for your meat and drink down to the earth or pavement, and take them from thence. Tables, that are for eaſe, delight, and conveniency, are, and muſt be, as high, if not higher, than the beds on which gueſts lye, or feates on which they ſit. Experience daily teacheth ſo much.</p>
                        <p>The very formes of the old <hi>Triclinia,</hi> kept as venerable Monuments to this day, do prove, Chriſt Sate not on the Ground; nor Lay on a low couch neare the Ground. Nor was it the faſhion of that Nation, in thoſe times, to eat their
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:47497:216"/>meat on the Pavement ſpread with Carpets. Nor can it be proved that in any of all thoſe great <hi>Feasts</hi> in the Jewiſh Law, whether they were ſacred or profane, they did eat their meat on the Floore, or Pavement. That they did <hi>Diſcumbere, veste ſtragulâ,</hi> Sit on Carpets being uppermoſt: <hi>in Stratis tapetibus,</hi> with cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Tapeſtry, I will not deny. <hi>Juvenal Satyra</hi> 5 <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. goeth further.</p>

                        <p>Indeed, when a great multitude followed our Saviour, and were fed miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly by him, becauſe it was in a deſert place, and there were no beds, no rooms, no tents, no tables, Chriſt commanded the people to <hi>ſit down on the Graſſe, Matth.</hi> 14.19. And there they did eat as they might, ſitting down by companies, on the green Graſſe; <hi>For there was much Graſſe in the place, John</hi> 6.10. But I reade not, that ever any of thoſe times, having plenty of neceſſary utenſils, well adorned, did eat their meales on the Earth, Floore, or Pavements: or that at any time, Chriſt did eate on the Ground, plaine Floore, or Pavement.</p>
                        <p>Nor was Queene <hi>Vaſhti</hi> her feaſt ſaid or likely to be on the ground, <hi>Eſther</hi> 1.9. In the Kings feaſt, The beds were of Gold and Silver, upon a pavement, of red, blue, black and white Marble, <hi>Eſther</hi> 1.6. and all theſe above the ground.</p>
                        <p>Nor can it be proved, that <hi>Eſthers</hi> banquet was kept by lying on the Floore, on Couches. It is ſaid, <hi>Eſther</hi> 7.8. <hi>The King returned out of the palace garden, into the place of the banquet of wine: and Haman was falne upon the bed whereon Eſther was.</hi> For <hi>Haman</hi> to have falne on the Earth, it had been convenient enough to his deſparate eſtate. But to fall upon the Queenes bed, was high pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. And to think there was no banquetting Table neare that bed, is to eſtabliſh an uneaſie kinde of eating, or drinking. Moſt ſure it is, as in <hi>Ahaſhuerus</hi> his great banquet, the beds are deſcribed as rayſed above the Floore, and the Floore above the Earth; ſo the Tables muſt be thought ſome way proportionable in height to the beds, for the fitter accommodation of eating or drinking.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the hitching up from the boſome to the breaſt, the diſtance is ſo ſmall, that we may ſay it was a poore hitch. And if S. <hi>John</hi> did ſo aſcend, and if ſuch aſcending doth prove a diſcumbing, yet might the diſcumbing be (and in all likelihood it was) not on low beds, neare the Earth; having onely a pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Table; but as the faſhion was, both of Jewes and Romans in thoſe times, on rayſed triclinary Bedſteds, with Tables ſomewhat higher.</p>

<pb n="573" facs="tcp:47497:216"/>in time of perſecution. Is it fit Chriſt ſhould conforme himſelfe to her in his Paſchatizing? or in the great Feaſt of the Euchariſt?

                        <p>IT is apparent that the faſhions of taking their Suppers were diverſe.

                        <p>Afterwards, the Romans made Square feaſting Tables, then Roundiſh: and their Beds at firſt were Low and Short; Afterwards, their Beds, their Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boords, their Triclinia, and Treſſels were of Braſſe, and farre both larger and higher. Then had they Round Tables of the Citron Tree, ſupported with feete made of Elephants teeth. <hi>Tully</hi> himſelfe bought a goodly one, at an unreaſonable price. <hi>Seneca</hi> had many of them.</p>

                        <p>One Table was Roundiſh: on which they placed their Wines; This they called <hi>Cylibantum,</hi> from the Pots and Cups which the Graecians call <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>I wiſh the excellent <hi>Heinſius</hi> had taken occaſion from theſe words to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged the point.</p>
                        <p>This I ſay; I ſhall hardly be perſwaded, if our Saviour did inſtitute his bleſſed Sacrament of the Euchariſt, and eate it on the Paſchalizing Table (which is moſt improbable) that he ever intended to make that an eternall patterne, or preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent for us, which he performed on ſuch an occaſion, (of the Paſſeover) as never ſhould be in uſe againe.</p>
                        <p>As before I referred it to thy judgement (Good Reader) whether were moſt probable, that Chriſt ſhould mingle his ſacred Euchariſt with Common meate, or take them dividedly: So here alſo (Chriſtian Reader) be thou Iudge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be likelieſt that when an upper Chamber was exquiſitely furniſhed, with convenient, or deſired utenſils, with ſeverall Tables (as you have heard was the faſhion) Chriſt would on the Floore adminiſter that heavenly food, or els goe to one of thoſe Tables, fit it, call his Apoſtles, and There adminiſter it? Let it not be forgotten, that Chriſt foreknew, the upper Chamber was decently adorned, and purpoſely ſent to have none other but it, as fitteſt for his turne. And if he had not made uſe of the things there, if he had fate upon the Ground, or on the Pavement, or laine on a poore low Couch at the ſacred food: a meaner houſe, a worſe fitted roome, higher or lower, might well have ſerved their turnes. But he would have a goodly Chamber, prepared, furniſhed, and large: and therefore we may well think, he made ſome uſe of the things There.</p>
                        <p>Sure we are, he made uſe of the Water-pots, and Water-Baſins, and Towell: for he powred water (which was in other veſſels) into the Baſin, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.5. And when he put off his Clothes, we may think, he laid them on a Table, Bench, Stooles, or Chayres, rather than on the ground, or pavement.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Aretius</hi> on <hi>Math.</hi> 26.17. ſaith, that <hi>Herod</hi> the King appointed to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in that houſe: and at it were hoſted with him, to whom Chriſt ſent. But when <hi>Herod</hi> was otherwiſe diverted, as ſome conceive, Chriſt invited himſelfe to the ſame houſe: Fitted you may be ſure, to entertaine a King: and ſo royally furniſhed.</p>
                        <p>For among the reſt, it is reported by <hi>Aretius</hi> in the ſame place, that either out of <hi>Herods,</hi> or the houſekeepers <hi>apparatus</hi> or preparation, Chriſt uſed <hi>Catino ex Smaragdo, quo nullus pretioſior viſus eſt unquam, nulla gemma nobilior, nulla ſpecies vaſis mirabilior:</hi> Than which <hi>Catinus,</hi> none ever was ſeene more pretious: no gemme more coſtly, or noble; no veſſell more wonderfull.</p>
                        <p>The Smaragdus is an Emerald of a greene colour, making the ayre greene about it, and by its greenneſſe, comforting the eyes of men; it preſerveth the
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:47497:217"/>wearer from the falling ſickneſſe: Eight graines of it drank, expelleth poyſon (as they ſay.) The Genoiſts in Liguria ſhew it to this day. And the Monkes of Lyons in France, ſhew the pretious Charger which Chriſt uſed in his Supper. But (ſaith <hi>Aretius</hi>) let a man beleeve what he liſt.</p>
                        <p>But becauſe the conſecrating of it upon a floore, was not impoſſible: and ſuch a thing might perhaps be, as that they might receive it on their Beds or Couches; yet ſince they were wont ſometimes to ſit up, and upright on their Beds, <hi>Pro re natâ,</hi> as occaſions led them: I ſhall never be otherwiſe perſwaded, but if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the holy Sacrament on their diſcumbing Couches, they did ariſe in their ſeverall turnes, and kneele, and pray, and worſhip; and Then partaked of the heavenly food: and then repoſed themſelves to heare our Saviours Sermon; which is properly diſtinguiſhed from Other his Sermons: and is juſtly called <hi>Sermo Domini in coenaculo;</hi> Chriſts Sermon in the Supping Chamber.</p>
                        <p>It muſt alſo be acknowledged, that a Table was not of abſolute neceſſitie. For the Table was to doe ſervice for the Food: not the Food for the Table. And the Supper cauſed the uſe of the Table: the Table did not cauſe the Supper; though the Supper, by a Metonymy, is called a Table, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 10.21.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, though we cannot ſay expreſly, whether the Table were Round or Square, on which Chriſt did eate his Second Supper, or his Paſchall; or deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine undoubtedly to which it was moſt inclining, yet I opine, (as it is in my Firſt Booke,) it approached nearer to a Square Table, having Three ſides incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed with Three Beds: the fourth ſide Open for the Servitors, to bring, change, or carry away ſuch things as they were directed: and ſo for the third Table, it is likely it was on a Livery boord or Table which ſtood in the ſame roome, ſquare rather than round.</p>

And let <hi>Beza</hi> take heed; for if the word <hi>(Table)</hi> be ſometimes uſed improperly, muſt it therefore be ſo in This place, in All places? This manner of expounding, is accompanied with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparate abſurdities. For why may not another expound any other words (though they handſomely anſwer the letter) by a Metaphor, if ſo be they be uſed meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically, in any one other place? And ſo we ſhall be deluded, as <hi>Origen</hi> was, and ſink and bury the holy Scriptures in Metaphors and Alluſions.</p>
                        <p>Concerning King <hi>David,</hi> before whom God prepared a Table in the preſence of his enemies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.5. I anſwer, this was not in the Wilderneſſe: for his enemies were preſent; but they were abſent from him in the Wilderneſſe; nor was it a Metaphoricall Table, where his head was annointed, and where his cup did overflow. Or if theſe Two laſt things were done really in the Wilderneſſe (as they were not) why might not a light ſmall Table be alſo brought forth among ſo many hundreds, as followed him. And yet this place is not a Record what was done, when he fled from <hi>Abſalon.</hi> Neither are the words, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.20. <hi>Thou wilt prepare a Table for me in the Wilderneſſe:</hi> as my learned friend ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, and miſtaketh: But the mutinous, and rebellious Iſraelites ſpake againſt God, ſaying, <hi>Can God furniſh a Table in the Wilderneſſe?</hi> And this was long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>David</hi> was borne: and no way concerned him. Againe, my worthy good friend hath onely conjecture, That the Earth was <hi>Davids</hi> Table. And this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative inference is worſe by farre; as the Floore was our Saviours Table.</p>
                        <p>For if <hi>David</hi> did ſo in urgent and extreame neceſſitie; and in the deſolate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſpitable Wilderneſſe: is it likely Chriſt would doe ſo where all neceſſary uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſils were prepared for a Feaſt?</p>
                        <p>Nor are the words of <hi>David, in Terminis,</hi> (as my learned friend ſuppoſeth)
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:47497:218"/>though they approach to the ſenſe; <hi>He that ſitteth at Table with me,</hi> Pſal. 41.9. And if they had been ſo; from the correſpondence betweene the Type and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, I ſhould rather have concluded; As <hi>Achitophel</hi> did eate at <hi>Davids</hi> Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: ſo did <hi>Judas</hi> at Chriſts Table. They both did eate at a Table, and both were notorious traytors. If <hi>Beza</hi> ſay, Such a Table as our Saviour did inſtitute this Supper on, or That Table was no Table indeed, but in name onely, or not a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble framed of wood; I muſt tell <hi>Beza,</hi> that none is able to prove his Negatives: and the contrary is evinced by their common uſance. And the word <hi>(Table)</hi> doth <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, and moſt properly ſignifie, ſomewhat to eate upon, rayſed from the ground. Nor can I finde in any place of S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> any inclination of him to this; That the earth, ground, plaine floore, or pavement, was the Table on which Chriſt inſtituted the holy Euchariſt.</p>
                        <p>So much againſt the opinion, that Chriſt celebrated his bleſſed Supper and Sacrament on the pavement, with humble ſubjection of my Writings to the Church of England, the uncorruptedſt part of Chriſts Militant Church: and with this ſolemne proteſtation, that though I differ in judgement, in this point, from the learned Doctor; yet I ſhall never differ from him in affection: but be ready upon better proofes to change ſomewhat of my opinion; and ſtill to love him.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, I ſhall fling water into the Sea, and miſpend time, to prove that the Jewiſh people made great and much uſe of Tables, long before Chriſts Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo downe to his death.</p>

                        <p>COncerning the bleſſed Euchariſt, it cannot be certainly knowne, on what ſpeciall Table it was adminiſtred; or what was the forme or faſhion of That Table. Two points are conſiderable; The firſt ſeemes more than probable to me; That it was adminiſtred, or celebrated on a Table. Secondly, I hold it likely, it was adminiſtred on a Table diſtinct from the Paſchall, and ordinary-Supper Table.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the firſt:</p>
                        <p>In the Temple at Hieruſalem, they had a Table of Shittim wood; <hi>two cubits the length thereof, and a cubite the breadth thereof, and a cubite and an halfe the height thereof,</hi> Exod. 25.23. <hi>And thouſhalt ſet upon the Table Shewbread before me alwayes,</hi> verſ. 30. There was no Long-ſquare Table of Incenſe; but the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar to burne Incenſe upon, was alſo of Shittim wood, foure-ſquare. <hi>A cubit the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof,</hi> Exod. 30.1. <hi>And it was two cubits high.</hi> The former Table, allegorically did ſignifie the Table of the body and blood of Chriſt, as <hi>Cornelius à Lapide</hi> on <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.2. avoucheth from <hi>Cyrill, Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome, Damaſcene:</hi> Therefore the Subſtance of the Type, was alſo a Table: and Chriſt celebrated the I ords Supper on a Table.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11.20. it is called the Lords Supper.</p>
                        <p>The Adminiſtring and Receiving of the Euchariſt, is called the Supper of the Lord. <hi>Auguſtine ad Januarium Epiſtolâ</hi> 118. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. affirmeth, that the Apoſtle calleth the very Receiving of the Euchariſt, the <hi>Dominicam coenam,</hi> the Supper of the Lord; So <hi>Ambroſe, Pelagius, Gloſſator, Lombardus, Hervaetus, Aquinas, Ric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kelius,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Eſtius</hi> on the 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11.) <hi>Theodoret</hi> and <hi>Oecumenius</hi> call <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicam coenam</hi> The Lords Supper, <hi>Domini Sacramentum,</hi> The Sacrament of the Lord: though <hi>Eſtius</hi> minceth the point.</p>
                        <p>But they were wont in thoſe times, to eate their Suppers on Tables, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Lazarus</hi> was one of them who ſate at the Table with Chriſt, when Chriſt ſaid; <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.30. <hi>Yee may eate and drinke at my Table in my kingdome;</hi> he draweth the Metaphor, from the Tables, on which he and others were wont to feed on in thoſe dayes. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.2. &amp;c. <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.27. <hi>The dogs eate of the crummes which
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:47497:218"/>fall from their Maſters Table.</hi> Therefore there was a diſtance betweene the Tables and the Ground. S. <hi>Mark.</hi> 7.28. varieth it thus; <hi>The dogs under the Tables eate of the childrens crummes.</hi> Therefore the Tables were not On the ground; when dogs could be under them. The rich man had a Table, from whence ſuch crummes fell, as would have fed <hi>Lazarus,</hi> Luk. 16.21. Therefore the Table was not On the ground, floore, or pavement, but Above it; and from it the crummes fell lower. So, Tables being <hi>in viridi obſervantiâ,</hi> in ordinary uſe among the Jewes in thoſe dayes: and Chriſt avoyding factious ſingularity, and running fairely with the ſtreame of thoſe times in things indifferent, we may conclude, Chriſt fed not from the pavement at any time, for ought that is recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or involved; But it is very likely, our Saviour on a Table did celebrate the holy Euchariſt. Tables were principally ordained to be eaten and drinkt upon, whether at ſacred or common Feaſts: <hi>Take this and eate it</hi> (as from a Table) <hi>and Christ tooke the cup</hi> (as from the Table) <hi>and gave thankes</hi> (as they uſed to doe at the Table) <hi>and gave it to them</hi> (as they were at Table) <hi>Drinke yee all of this</hi> (as was wont to be done at the Table) <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.27. <hi>Act.</hi> 6.2. <hi>It is not reaſon we ſhould leave the Word of God, and ſerve Tables.</hi> And theſe Tables were for the poore, or for their holy feaſts of charity; if not for the receiving of the moſt holy Euchariſt alſo.</p>
                        <p>For it may be well obſerved, Men were choſen to ſerve Tables, full of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt; <hi>of honest report and wiſdome;</hi> as <hi>Stephen</hi> was a man <hi>full of faith, and of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> verſe 5. <hi>full of faith and tower,</hi> verſe 8. conſecrated to that worke by prayer, and impoſition of hands, with as much ceremony and ſolemne maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, as others were choſen to be Presbyters; nay more, <hi>viz.</hi> with the generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and joynt action of all the Apoſtles. To ſerve at Common Tables alone, ſuch worthy Heroes were not fitteſt to be deſtinated, or appointed, that I may uſe the Scripture phraſe; meaner people might, and would have ſerved the turne. But theſe ſanctified Deacons, did not onely take care of the poore, but admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred at the moſt holy Tables, on which the Euchariſt was celebrated. <hi>Ignatius Epiſtol. ad Trallenſes,</hi> almoſt in the beginning; <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>: Yee ought to pleaſe the Deacons, the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the myſteries of Chriſt in all things; for they are not the ſervitors of meats and drinkes, but <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, the Miniſters of the Church of God: doe you reverence them as Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe Vicars they are.</p>
                        <p>My collection is; Sacred things, yea the moſt holy Euchariſt was celebrated Then on Tables. And in all likelihood, from the example of Chriſt, who conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated the bleſſed Sacrament on a Table. Nor doe the Apoſtles think it unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to ſerve Tables, either common, or ſacred, ſimply and abſolutely: (for the works were devout) but comparatively, and referentially. They would not neglect the preaching of the Word of God, nor exclude themſelves from It to ſerve Tables: In this ſenſe, S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Chriſt ſent me not to Baptize, but to preach the Goſpel:</hi> yet both Baptiſing, and Serving at Tables, eſpecially the Sacred Ones, were divine offices.</p>
                        <p>Chriſt was given for us, in the Sacrifice; was given to us, in the Sacrament. In the firſt, <hi>per modum victimae,</hi> as an offring; in the laſt, <hi>per modum epuli,</hi> (as Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Andrews</hi> hath it) as in a Banquet. Who knoweth not, Banquets are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſet on Tables? In the Feaſtings of our great Ones, you may perhaps, find out the Jewiſh faſhion of Feaſtings. For as oft times our people ariſe, when the firſt and ſecond courſes are removed; and other meat, and meſſes carried away: and go to another Table, and Banquet of <hi>Sweet-meats,</hi> as the cloſe of all: So very well may it be, that when <hi>Judas</hi> was excluded out of that room, and gone down ſtaires, and forth of doores, Chriſt and his Apoſtles might ariſe from their former Feaſting, and at another Table apply themſelves to this Sacred banquet of the <hi>Holiest, Heavenliest Sweet-meat:</hi> ſince more devotion was required at this moſt Sacred food, than at their other repaſt: of which hereafter.</p>

Beſides, I deſire to ſee one proofe where ever any of Chriſts Apoſtles, or any Jew of thoſe times, did feed from the Ground, Floore or Pavement, when they did eat in any houſe well-furniſhed.</p>
                        <p>I cannot omit another place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.21. <hi>Ye cannot be partakers of the Lords Table, and of the Table of Devils.</hi> That the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the ſacred Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt in the firſt place, appeareth by the precedent verſes. <hi>The Cup of bleſſing which wee bleſſe, is it not the Communion of the Blood of Chriſt? The Bread which wee breake, is it not the Communion of the Body of Chriſt?</hi> verſ. 17. Here are both <hi>Species,</hi> both <hi>Kinds.</hi> Chriſt bleſſed the Cup, and ſo do we, before, and in the Conſecration: and this is the Communion of Chriſts blood. Giving of thanks preceded conſecration.</p>
                        <p>The Heathen had Altars, on which they made offrings to their Gods, the Devils: and they had alſo Tables, from which they did participate of things Offered.</p>
                        <p>It was lawfull to go to the Tables and Feaſts of the Gentiles, and to eate <hi>whatſoever was ſet before them.</hi> 1. Cor. 10.27. But they might not approach to the Pagan Altars, to partake of them; Nor eat any thing in <hi>Idolio;</hi> in the Idols Temple: Nor, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, As a thing offred to Idols; <hi>no though a man did but ſay ſo, verſ.</hi> 28. Yet Chriſtians partaked even of the Sacrifices, which were upon, and taken from the Heathen Altars, on which they were Sacrificed, if they knew it not; as the Gentiles and Jews alſo: <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> 18.1. &amp;c. though not Altars, but Tables were principally ordained to eat upon; <hi>Yet they, who waited at the Altar, are partakers with the Altar,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.13.</p>
                        <p>Chriſt could not expect an Altar in an upper chamber, of a private man. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars were no part of chamber-furniture. The Jews might have no other perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Altars, after their ſetting in Hieruſalem, bu two; The Altar of Incenſe, and the Altar of Sacrifice.</p>
                        <p>Chriſt may be ſaid, in a ſort, to be the Altar, the Offring, and the Prieſt, when he was Sacrificed on the Croſſe. Other than a Metaphoricall Altar he uſed not, he was not.</p>

                        <p>But he conſecrated the ſaving Euchariſt on a Table; and therefore is it cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Lords Table. And becauſe Chriſt did ſo, all other Chriſtians were the apter to do ſo, and for a while called the Church-Altars, Tables, in reference to Chriſts firſt Inſtitution upon a Table.</p>
                        <p>For in times of perſecution, they could well uſe none, but Tables: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth the Primitive Church oft call them Tables: and ſeldome Altars; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which they were not admitted, to adminiſter the Sacrament of the body, and blood of the Lord. Nor did they carry Altar or Altars from houſe to houſe, from City to City, from Countrey to Countrey, as they Communicated in ſeverall Houſes, in ſeverall Cities, and Countreys, and for a while, daily ſo communicated; but uſed the Tables ſuch as they were, made by Art, whereſoever they came. Nor perhaps, did they ſtand on the particular conſecration, either of Tables, or of Cups, and Veſſels to hold the Body and Blood of Chriſt; but in the fiery furnace of perſecution, were content ſometimes to make uſe of ſuch things as could be had, and rather made them holy, than found them holy.</p>
                        <p>But he who from hence will think that the name of Altar is unlawfull, or of a late invention: or that they were excluded from Chriſtian Churches: or that there were Tables allowed, and every where ſet up in the Churches: Or that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars were deſtroyed generally, or for the moſt part: Or that even Altars them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were not ſometimes called Tables, with an eye to Chriſts firſt inſtitution: Or that will cry-up Tables, to cry-down Altars: He knoweth not the different uſances of the Church in times of perſecution and cut of it; but taketh advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of words, to ſet aſunder things, which well may ſtand together; and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:47497:219"/>with a ſtrong by as to his own works. Neither would I have my ſpeciall friend to precipitate himſelfe into the other extreame: or ſo to fix his mind on Altars, ſo to undervalew Tables, as to maintain, or publiſh that Chriſt did not celebrate the Heavenly Euchariſt on a Table; and that he inſtituted it on a plain Floore, or pavement: which opinion I think was ſcarce ever heard off, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeares after the firſt Inſtitution of the Sacrament.</p>
                        <p>The extract, or exempt eſpecially appropriated to our purpoſe, is this; Not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Devils in a kind of imitation of God Almighty this worſhip, had by the Heathen, Tables erected, and conſecrated to them, of which they took part, and were allowed their divident or portion, on which they fed ſometimes in the Temples of their Idols, ſometimes at home. But even the holy Chriſtians in their beſt perfection, had diverſe Tables, on which they did adminiſter the Lords Supper, and partaked of the holy Communion, and they were called the Tables of the Lord. For the Lord himſelfe, and his holy Ones, a long time after him, adminiſtred the bleſſed Euchariſt on Tables.</p>

                        <p>THe ſecond point, held probable, was, and is; The holy Euchariſt was admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred by Chriſt on a Table different and variant from the Paſchall, and Ordinary Supper-Table.</p>

But we underſtand a Man Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall in his mind; and do give Brutes only Reaſonable ſenſe; which <hi>Aquinas</hi> calleth Eſtimative. Is this, all this diſcourſe come now to this? I will take a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſpeak as I pleaſe: and ſo I will ſet up new poſitions, and contradict all in my way that ever was ſaid before: and then I will ſo qualifie it, that I will have only new tearmes, new expreſſions, and yet but old matter: that all the Reaſon of Beaſts be but the Eſtimative faculty (as <hi>Aquinas</hi> calleth it.)

                        <p>And though we muſt be humble, and Scepticall, where we have no firme footing; yet if we put into the weights two opinions with their beſt circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, we are not forbid upon a diligent triall, and ſearch of them (not in the Bakers ballance, but in the exacter ſcales of the Gold-ſmith) to ſay ſuch an opinion is ſo many Graines, Scruples, Dramms, Ounces, or Pounds better, and heavier than the other.</p>
                        <p>Proceed wee then to examination, whether it were a diſtinct Table, or no?</p>
                        <p>That it was celebrated After Supper, no man can contradict. If it had been at the Paſchall, or at the Common Supper, or during their turnes or times, no man could deny but it had been adminiſtred at the ſame Table. And too many Chriſtians not obſerving that point, have run into many errors, and let ſlide from their pens apparent miſtakings. But at that Table it could not be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred conveniently. And herein again I appeale to any learned man, or good Chriſtian ſoule: Which is fitter of the two? That the moſt wonderfull Sacrament ſhould be celebrated, as the Recipients Lay along, or Sate at a Table incompaſſed with Three beds? Or at another Table, better accommoded for their devout participation, and graced with Diviner food?</p>
                        <p>With reference to the parties Recipient, theſe may bee the Arguments.</p>
                        <p>In Naturals, Morals, Politicks, theſe Axioms hold. <hi>De minimis minima cura est habenda: &amp; de maximis maxima cura eſt habenda.</hi> Of leaſt things the leaſt care is to be taken: and of greateſt things, the greateſt care. Upon this ground, we preferre the Body before Raiment: the Soule before the Body; the joyes of Heaven, above the pleaſures of Earth; the love of God, above the love of Men. <hi>Charitas eſt ordinata:</hi> Charity proceeds by Order; and chieflyeſt loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to things moſt neceſſary. When <hi>Martha</hi> was carefull, and troubled about many things, Chriſt ſaid to her, <hi>One thing is needfull, and Mary hath choſen that good part, which ſhall not bee taken away from her,</hi> Luke 10.42. <hi>Seeke yee Firſt the Kingdome of God,</hi> Matth. 6.33. <hi>Take no thought for the morrow.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I have ſeene a naturall foole hold up his arme to receive a blow, which was aymed at his head. And he is little leſſe than an Idiot, who beſtoweth more care on ſmall, or poore things, than he doth on great and better things.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Domitian</hi> was a foole to beſtow his time in killing of Flyes, when the care of the whole Roman Empire lay on his ſhoulders. The Roman Empire was not diſturbed by a Fly.</p>
                        <p>The particular nature will deſtroy it ſelfe, to preſerve the Generall: Fire will deſcend, rather than there ſhould be a <hi>Vacuum:</hi> Things will rather ſuffer any evill, than vacuity. All, and every particular nature by it ſelfe, and with others, doth ſo abhorre <hi>vacuum,</hi> vaine emptineſſe, that they all concurre to remedy it againſt their owne private inclinations, and diſpoſitions; to keepe as it were their Common-wealth whole and ſound.

                        <p>Concerning Chriſts Body in the firſt place.</p>
                        <p>And ſhall we think, that any thing in the earth, is equall to the pretious Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Blood of Chriſt? <hi>We are not redeemed with corruptible things, as ſilver and gold,—but with the pretious Blood of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.19. Heb. 9.14. <hi>The Blood of Christ purgeth our conſciences from dead works, to ſerve the living God.</hi> 1 Joh. 1.7. <hi>The Blood of Christ cleanſeth us from All ſinne. He waſhed us from our ſinnes in his owne Blood,</hi> Revel. 1.5. <hi>and hath made us Kings and Prieſts unto God,</hi> as followeth. His Blood was, and is of infinite merit. And if there ſhould be created as many worlds of people, as there are now people in this world, and if God had made the like covenant with them, as he hath done with us; though every one of thoſe were great ſinners, yet if they did repent, and beleeve in Chriſt, every one ſhould be forgiven, and ſaved; and for all this God ſhould remaine a debtor to the Croſſe. For betweene Finite and Infinite, is no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.</p>
                        <p>Will not the thought hereof ſtirre us up to more ſolemne devotion, when we receive It, than when we take our common repaſt? I ſhall never be perſwaded the Apoſtles were ſo regardleſſe, ſo uncivill, as to take ſo heavenly a benefit, without humble thanks, prayers, and ſublimated devotions. And what is held ſordid, and ſlovenly among us, to lie along, or ſit, when people receive it from us ordinary Miniſters; muſt it not needs be much worſe, when the Lord of heaven admini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>red his owne Blood, in his owne Perſon, if the Apoſtles did ſo? Therefore I ſhall hardly beleeve the Apoſtles partaked of that heavenly food either ſitting or repoſing themſelves on their diſcubitory beds.</p>
                        <p>Concerning his Body: How admirable things are ſpoken of it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.50? <hi>This is the Bread;</hi> and it is very likely, he pointed at his owne Selfe, when he ſaid Thoſe words. And the Antitheſis following evinceth, he ſpake not of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall food. But above all, the declarative poſitive Aſſeveration, in verſe 51. ſeemeth to prove ſo much, &amp;c. to the fifty-ninth verſe. <hi>This is my Body which is Given for you,</hi> Luk. 22.19. <hi>This is my Body, which is Broken for you,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.24. <hi>He eateth and drinketh Damnation, who diſcerneth not the Lords Body,</hi> verſe 29.</p>
                        <p>A poore diſcerning there is of the Lords Body, if they ſhall eare It with no more preparation, no more devotion, than they doe Other meate in the ſame or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and manner, and at the ſame Table ſitting, or diſcumbing. Let me emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty my ſoule into thankfull humble prayers; and my body be powred out as water on the earth by loweſt proſtration: yet I ſhall think I am not enough dejected, or mortified. <hi>Luk.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Peter fell downe at Jeſus knees, ſaying, Depart from mee, for an a ſinfull man, O Lord.</hi> Did he ſo, when he faw but a great draught of fiſhes, and <hi>was aſtoniſhed at it?</hi> verſe 9.</p>
                        <p>Therefore let no man imagine, he would ſit, or lie along, in a careleſſe, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout poſture, when he Beheld, and Received the food of his ſoule, by which his ſinnes were remitted, and the ſinfull old man pardoned, and ſanctified.</p>
                        <p>S. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he adminiſtred the holy Communion, preached unto the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and <hi>continued his ſpeech untill midnight,</hi> Act. 20.7. And when they had received the Sacrament, S. <hi>Paul</hi> talked a long whole, <hi>even till breake of day,</hi> verſe 11.</p>
                        <p>That the <hi>Breaking of Bread,</hi> was the Giving and Receiving of the holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, is proved; Firſt, becauſe it was on the Firſt day of the weeke; that is, the <hi>Lords day.</hi> Secondly, And the Diſciples were gathered together to Breake Bread: which in the Scripture phraſe, is the Euchariſt. Thirdly, S. <hi>Paul</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched before, and preached after, which was not uſuall at common meales, if the Euchariſt had not preceded. Fourthly, he preached till Midnight. But then they were wont to fall to their common meat. Fifthly, it was a ſacred Farewell
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:47497:221"/>of S. <hi>Paul</hi> with the Diſciples; and ſo in likelyhood, he both tooke the heavenly <hi>Viaticum</hi> himſelfe, and imparted it to Others.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Beza</hi> on the place acknowledgeth, That after the myſterious celebration, they uſed to eate common food. So the Euchariſt (in his opinion) was firſt. But <hi>Auguſtine Epiſtola</hi> 86. ſaith, <hi>The bread videtur eſſe Euchariſticus,</hi> ſeemes to be Euchariſticall, or the bread of the Lords Supper. And this expoſition is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by <hi>Act.</hi> 2.42. <hi>They continued in Breaking of Bread, and Payers.</hi> For though they were not ſparing of their materiall bread and meat one to another, yet this place ſeemeth ſpoken of Spirituall food onely. So the Syriac tranſlation; uſing in this Chapter, the Greeke word <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>; with whom agreeth the Arabick Interpreter (ſaith <hi>Beza</hi>) in ſenſe, though not in the ſame words. Which Syriac Interpreter <hi>Beza</hi> aſſenteth not unto, for reſtraining it to the Euchariſt. But <hi>Beza</hi> might have conſidered, that the communication of things Temporall, or of both Spirituall and Temporall mixed together, followeth at large, verſe 44. &amp;c. <hi>Lorinus, Luther, Calvin, Gagneius, Salmeron, Gaſpar, Sanctius, Montanu:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore better interpret it of the Euchariſt. <hi>Lorinus</hi> proveth it by <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.35. <hi>He was knowne of them in Breaking of Bread.</hi> Which <hi>Cajetan</hi> wittily, but ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly ſaith, was a wonderfull Breaking of Bread, without hands or knife; For, it ſhould ſeeme he forgot, it is ſaid, verſe 30. <hi>As he ſate at meate with them, He tooke Bread, and bleſſed it, and Brake it, and gave to them.</hi> Againe, it is <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. Which may be tranſlated, In the breaking of That bread; even the Bread Euchariſticall: For of it doe <hi>Auguſtine de Conſenſu Evangelistarum,</hi> 3.25. <hi>Chryſoſtome Homilia</hi> 9. <hi>ex variis Matthaei locis,</hi> and many others, both Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and new Writers expound it.</p>
                        <p>In all the Communions recorded in Scripture, either more apparently pointed at, or more reſervedly deſcribed, not One was celebrated on the Ground; not One upon an Altar; What then remaineth, but they were celebrated on Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles? And to returne to the old place; When S. <hi>Paul</hi> preached in an high cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, even three ſtories high, could you there looke for an Altar? or could they there, and then, ſo many as they were, ſit, or lie on Couches on the Floore, and take that ſaving food from the plaine floore, or pavement? No man will ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it.</p>
                        <p>Did S. <hi>Paul</hi> fall on <hi>Eutychus</hi> to recover him, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.10? and did he uſe no humble Geſture when he gave and received the bleſſed Euchariſt?</p>
                        <p>In regard of the party Adminiſtrant, thus we may proceed to argue.</p>
                        <p>Did Chriſt riſe up, to waſh their feete? and did he not riſe up when he waſhed their Soules, and gave them heavenly food, food better than Manna?</p>
                        <p>Oh how reverend, lowly, and humble was Chriſt, when he was at his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers? <hi>When he prayed, he kneeled downe,</hi> Luk. 22.41. <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, pitched, or ſetled on both his knees. <hi>He fell on the Ground, and prayed,</hi> Mark. 14.35. <hi>He fell on his Face, and prayed,</hi> Matth. 26.39. His Face adored of men and Angels. He fell ſo for us, and that we may learne ſo to doe; ſince the Diſciple is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Maſter.</p>

I have read of a late devout Cardinall, who being on his death-bed, and almoſt dead, yet did ſtrive to goe out of his bed, and to kneele on his knees, becauſe he judged it ſinfull to receive the food of his ſoule lying all along; and ſo by others he was helped up, and ſtaying till he had communicated kneeling on both knees This is an example worthy to be imitated, though he were a Cardinall.</p>

When Chriſt bleſſed any, his Geſture was moſt holy, with eyes and hands elevated. Did he bleſſe and conſecrate the holy Bread no otherwiſe than if it had been to have been ſtill but ordinary bread?</p>
                        <p>When he conſecrated the heavenlieſt Food, can we think he ſate ſtill?</p>
                        <p>At the firſt inſtitution of any great matter, is more reverence exhibited, than afterwards. <hi>Abraham</hi> made a Great Feaſt that day, that <hi>Iſaac</hi> was weaned, <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis</hi> 21.8.</p>
                        <p>When Chriſt received his Baptiſm, how humbled he himſelfe to <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist;</hi> the Creator to the creature, the Maſter to the ſervant? And he tooke a long journey, even from <hi>Galilee</hi> to <hi>Jordan</hi> to be Baptized of him. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.13. and queſtionleſſe put off ſome of his cloths, if not all, and deſcended into <hi>Jordan;</hi> and by his own fleſh ſanctified the River <hi>Jordan,</hi> and all other waters to the myſticall waſhing away of ſin: as (before our Communion book was made) <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and <hi>Beda,</hi> on <hi>Luke</hi> 3. and <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> and <hi>Hierom</hi> have it on the 3 of <hi>Matth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Chriſts Actions, or Paſſion at Baptiſm, were ratified for good from Heaven. The Heavens were opened, the Spirit of God deſcended like a Dove, and lighted upon him (on him alone, and not on any others) to ſhew there was no miſtake. And a voyce from heaven was heard, ſaying; <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed; Matth.</hi> 3.16. and 17. <hi>verſ.</hi> Both his Perſon, and all his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, well pleaſed God.</p>
                        <p>Let us therefore parallel the Sacraments, and conſider but the firſt Inſtitution of the ſacred Body, and Blood of Chriſt; and let any Chriſtian-devout-ſoule judge whether Common, and ordinary poſture befitted it; and not rather a more Solemne, Divine, Devout, and Heavenly geſture? And, that in likelyhood to be rather on another Table, than as they Sate, or Lay on their diſcubitory beds. So much be ſaid to probabilize that the holy Euchariſt was celebrated not on the ſame Table where the other Two Suppers were eaten upon, but on another Table.</p>
                        <p>Thus, Chriſt being in all likelyhood come to another Table, prepared, and well-furniſhed with Bread and Wine; am I brought home to the next point of my propounded method.</p>

As Chriſt was Circumciſed, which hee needed not: and was Baptized by <hi>John,</hi> to the Baptiſm of Repentance, though Chriſt had no cauſe to Repent: and laſtly, as he took the Euchariſt, which like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he did not need nor want. To this laſt point, he either anſwereth nothing (which he ſeldome doth) or elſe it was ſuppreſſed by higher authority: or his anſwer is involved in theſe words; <hi>Quicquid de hoc ſit,</hi> and in this ſenſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt received the bleſſed Sacrament, or received it not, I will not now ſpeak, I will paſſe it over, or the like.</p>

And he anſwereth (ſtealing almoſt all from <hi>Aquinas</hi>) There have not been wanting, who have ſaid, Chriſt gave his Body to his Diſciples, but himſelfe took it not. <hi>Luther de Abrogandâ Miſsâ privatâ</hi> reſolveth, Chriſt took not that bleſſed Sacrament; and thence collecteth (if <hi>Soto</hi> belye him not) that other Prieſts ought not to take it, but to give Both kinds to the Laity. If <hi>Luther</hi> ſo ſaid, <hi>Soto</hi> well reproveth him, and confuteth him; becauſe by <hi>Luthers</hi> argument, the Prieſts are of worſe condition and in a worſe ſtate than the people. Which none, but a popular Claw-back, or Calfe of the people will ſay. <hi>Aquinas</hi> his Inference is much ſounder. Becauſe the Miniſters with us, receive it firſt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we conclude Chriſt firſt took it. For (ſay I) Chriſt commanded us, to do as He did. And the Church evermore ſince Chriſts time doing ſo, that is, the Prieſts not giving the bleſſed Sacrament, till themſelves had firſt received, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth unforcedly, that Chriſt took it firſt.</p>

There be many Canons of the Church, which command the Prieſts, firſt of all to receive: So is it in the Councell of <hi>Toledo.</hi> If they that Sacrifice, eate not, they are guilty of the Lords Sacrament: 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 10.18. <hi>Are not they which eate of the Sacrifices, partakers of the Altar:</hi> For if to participate, be to eate, and the Sacrificers be the chiefe partakers; it reſulteth, They muſt firſt eate. The like was practiſed in the old Law. The Prieſt was ſerved even of the peoples offrings, before the people themſelves, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.13. &amp;c. If you ſay, that was but an uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, and prophanation of <hi>Ely</hi> his ſonnes, then ſee the Law it ſelfe.</p>

                           <hi>Soto</hi> his proofe for the Affirmative, is a ridiculous one. <hi>David fuit figura hujus: David</hi> was a figure hereof, who, 1 <hi>Samuel</hi> 21.13. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before <hi>Achiſh, Suis ſe manibus referebat: ſic Chriſtus ſuum corpus ſuis tenebat manibus, &amp; ſuo ſumebat ore:</hi> So Chriſt held his owne body in his hands: and received it with his mouth. I anſwer, there are no ſuch words, nor words tending to that purpoſe, in the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, either of <hi>Hentenius,</hi> or <hi>Saint-andreanus;</hi> or in <hi>Vatablus,</hi> or the Interlineary, nor in the Greeke, or Hebrew. Nor can I judge from what words in that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Soto</hi> did gather his wild <hi>protaſis,</hi> or firſt part of the typicall compariſon. A weake proofe doth harme to a good cauſe; and ſo hath <hi>Soto</hi> done in this point.</p>

He firſt Received, then Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred. He firſt celebrated the Euchariſt, then made his Sermon in <hi>coenaculo:</hi> or Sermon in the Supping Chamber.</p>
                        <p>Before be Inſtituted his Baptiſme, he was Baptized. When he ſaid to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, <hi>Doe this in remembrance of me;</hi> if followeth, he did take it Firſt Himſelfe.</p>
                        <p>The Gloſſe on <hi>Ruth</hi> 3. ſaith, Chriſt did eate and drinke That Supper, when he delivered the Sacrament of his Body and Blood to his Diſciples.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Soto</hi> bringeth this objection, When Chriſt ſaid; <hi>Take and Eate;</hi> the queſtion is; Whether He did eate or no? If you ſay, He had eaten, this is againſt that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, becauſe he had not Then conſecrated the bread. For by the ſubſequent words, he did conſecrate and ſay, <hi>This is my body.</hi> If He had not eaten then, it is apparent, He did not before his Diſciples: For reaching it to them, he ſaid, <hi>This is my Body.</hi> I anſwer (ſaith <hi>Soto</hi>) He firſt broke the bread into Thirteene pieces; which when he had in a diſh together in his hands; He ſaid, <hi>Take, eate, this is my body,</hi> receiving his own part Firſt.</p>

                           <pb n="589" facs="tcp:47497:224"/>
For he kept Feaſt with them: and the nature of a Feaſt requireth, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viter feed with the Invited; He fed with them in the Firſt Supper: He dranke with them in the Second Supper. In the Beſt Supper, and the Supper which was moſt properly his Owne, did he nor Eate nor Drinke?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Barradius,</hi> thus; <hi>Accepit ex mensâ panem azymum: benedixit: in partes Duo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decem fregit, eas conſecravit: unam ſumpſit, reliquas diſtribuit:</hi> He tooke from the Table unleavened bread: He bleſſed it: He brake it into twelve parts: He conſecrated it: One He tooke; the Other he diſtributed. Therefore even our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary being our judge, He was at a Table. <hi>Iudas</hi> was not preſent: for then there ſhould have been Thirteene pieces or morſels: Chriſt himſelfe received himſelfe. So they cannot tax me for theſe opinions; or theſe opinions for novelty, but they muſt needs condemne <hi>Barradius,</hi> and diverſe others of their own ſide.</p>

To keepe them from being troubled at it, as they were troubled when ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fell off from him, he dranke his own blood firſt himſelfe.

                           <hi>Iſychlus</hi> addeth; Chriſt in that Supper firſt dranke his blood, Then gave it to his Diſciples.</p>
                        <p>Yea, but it is not read, that he ate his Body, and dranke his blood. <hi>Soto</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth; It is read, that He Tooke the bread, He Tooke the Cup: and though it muſt be expounded, He Tooke them into his hand, or hands: yet it is not ſaid, He tooke them into his hands onely; but He tooke them himſelfe, as he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Diſciples to take them. Therefore when he ſaid to them, <hi>Take, eate, drinke;</hi> ſo when He tooke them, it is deducible, He did after the ſame manner eate and drinke.</p>
                        <p>The old Rimer before cited, is authentique enough in this laſt point.

                        <p>It is anſwered (ſaith he) Chriſt is not compared to the place by his proper Dimenſions; but by the Dimenſions of the ſeverall Species; ſo that whereſoever They are, there is his body and blood: Therefore becauſe he had the bread and wine in his mouth and ſtomach, when he ate Them, he did eate himſelfe. And to this there needs no diviſion, between the receiver, and the received.</p>

Chriſt needed not the ſpirituall receiving, for he received no Grace from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:47497:225"/>The Sacramentall reception is improper: proper to ſinners onely, and ſo unfit for Chriſt. He anſwereth with <hi>Aquinas;</hi> Chriſt received himſelfe both Spiritually and Sacramentally: And ſo before <hi>Aquinas, Alexander Hales</hi> ſettled at laſt in that opinion. For though Chriſt received no increaſe of Grace or Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by the Sacrament, becauſe he needed none, yet he received a ſpirituall Taſte, and ſweet enjoying of Delight, which are effects of this Sacrament. So he tooke it alſo Sacramentally. To take it Sacramentally without increaſe of Grace, hapneth from hence; that the Receiver (Then) is not capable of Grace. And this may come to paſſe two wayes: Either becauſe he puts an impediment or block againſt it, as he is a ſinner; or becauſe a man is ſo full of Grace, that he cannot receive an Increaſe of Grace, as Chriſt was.</p>
                        <p>Much of this diſcourſe proceeded from the learned <hi>Dominicus Soto,</hi> Confeſſor to <hi>Charles</hi> the Fiſt, which, becauſe he moſt inlargeth <hi>Aquinas,</hi> I have tranſlated, and cleared: and inlarged him.</p>
                        <p>To conclude; let me adde, that Chriſt might well take the bleſſed Euchariſt himſelfe for example ſake, to Teach us what we ſhould doe; who may recieve much good by taking it; and ſhould imitate him, by taking it firſt our ſelves, before we adminiſter it unto Others. For thus did he doe diverſe Actions in his life, to Teach us to doe the like.</p>

That the Apoſtles, though they did <hi>concaenare cum Chriſto;</hi> yet they did not <hi>concelebrare.</hi> Chriſt did it by himſelfe; the Apoſtles did not aſſiſt him in Conſecration: but he leaveth <hi>Aquinas</hi> without expoſition in the maine point, Whether Chriſt are his owne Body, and dranke his own Blood?</p>

                           <hi>Franciſcus Lucas Brugenſis</hi> on <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. ſaith in theſe words; <hi>Chriſtus ipſe comêdit, priuſquam diſcipuli ejus: qui tamen non comêdit, priuſquam pronuntiaſſet haec verba; Hoc est corpus meum:</hi> Chriſt did Eate before his Apoſtles did; yet did he not Eate before he had ſaid, <hi>This is my Body.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Laſtly; all the Fathers, who ſay, Chriſt communicated with <hi>Iudas,</hi> are clearely for the Affirmative.</p>
                        <p>If by theſe words; <hi>My Fathers Kingdome,</hi> Matth. 26.29. and theſe; <hi>The Kingdome of God,</hi> Mark. 14.25. the bleſſed Euchariſt be pointed at, and meant, (as is likely:) then apparent it is, Himſelfe dranke of his owne blood in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Euchariſt; for he profeſſed, He would drinke no more of the fruit of the Vine, but onely in the holy Euchariſt.</p>
                        <p>Biſhop <hi>Lake</hi> in his Sermon upon <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.26. &amp;c. ſaith; It may well be preſumed, that Chriſt did receive it Himſelfe. For in his owne perſon he did ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie and honour, both Circumciſion and the Paſſcover. Alſo he was baptized and ſanctified the water of Jordan: Why ſhould we queſtion his Taking of the Euchariſt? That he did ſo, needed not to be expreſſed, becauſe of the corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondency of This Sacrament to That of the Paſſeover.</p>
                        <p>Indeed Chriſt needed not partake. But by his owne participation, he gave vertue to all the Sacraments: So he needed not to die for Himſelfe; but he dyed for us; To this effect, that holy and learned Prelate, now a great Saint in heaven.</p>

Some there are who ſay, That all the Geſtures which we uſe in religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, may be brought to Two heads. Some belong to Hope; as firſt the Lifting up of the eyes; which doe crave or expect ſome good thing. Secondly, the Lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up of the hands to reach at mercy offered, or ſet forth. The other Geſtures belong to Humiliation; as the Uncovering of the head, is as the laying downe of the crowne glory, and majeſty that Man hath; and a baring of Mans merit, or emptying himſelfe of worth, to give it to the party worſhipped. Secondly, the beating of the Breaſt: ſhewing that in it is ſin, which ought to be expecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated. Thirdly, Bowing of the Knee; which is a great token of the hearts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition. But ſomewhat is defective in this Dichotomy; of which more fully hereafter. I returne to the <hi>Queres.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Concerning the firſt; Remember what I writ in the laſt point ſave one, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our Saviours extraordinary devout Geſtures at his Prayers, which are not like to be unbended or ſlackned, in matters of as high, if not an higher ſtrain: and yet, as I opine, accompanied with divine prayers alſo, which in Chriſt were very frequent.</p>
                        <p>Some Geſture or other, is abſolutely neceſſary, at the Receiving of the holy Sacrament. By a morall neceſſitie, Comelineſſe and Decency is commanded: though the naturall neceſſity deſcendeth not to the individuality of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; but is content in generall, that there be ſome Geſture, as it is alſo with other Circumſtances, <hi>viz.</hi> that there be ſome Perſons, ſome Place, ſome Time, ſome Preparation, ſome Comelineſſe.</p>
                        <p>What the particular Geſture or Geſtures, or How, or When they varied, or how Long each continued, cannot be demonſtrated. Yet it is moſt certaine, he uſed the devouteſt, and moſt fitting Geſture or Geſtures; none could goe before him, or beyond him in chooſing the beſt way to ſerve God. Men are not at their Common refections, and eſpecially at Feaſts, tyed, and bound to keepe one poſture; and doe they not now and then ſtand Up, then Sit, then Bow, and uſe ſeverall decent behaviour? Let not that be denied to Chriſt and his Prieſts in the adminiſtration of the holieſt Supper, but with all convenient variation of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, <hi>Prore natâ,</hi> as occaſion ſerved; and moſt anſwerable, and conducible to devotion.</p>
                        <p>They were wont in old time to bow downe the body, then kneele, and pray; And from bending they deſcended to kneeling: From kneeling, they fell downe on their faces and prayed; then roſe up againe on their knees, and prayed againe: then did ſtand up, and prayed alſo.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Daniel</hi> 6.10. <hi>He kneeled upon his knees, and prayed, and gave thankes alſo.</hi> 1 <hi>Chronicles</hi> 6.13. <hi>Solomon kneeled downe on his knees, before all the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Iſrael: and ſpread forth his hands towards heaven.</hi> And, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.54. <hi>Solomon aroſe from kneeling on his knees, with his hands ſpread up to heaven.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>No man doubteth, but in prayer time they moſt commonly kneeled: In wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping God, they ſometimes bowed their heads downe, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.20.

                        <p>ACcording to the Degrees of Hope or Feare, there are Degrees alſo of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: The lifting up of the Eyes to Heaven in Prayer, is the moſt uſuall, common, though the leaſt kind of Adoration.

                           </gap>, <hi>Not ſo Much;</hi> as if that were a meane, if not the meaneſt Degree. The Publican lift up his Heart. That is moſt true: for the devout Prayer, which he empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically couched in thoſe few words, proveth it; <hi>God be mercifull to me a ſinner.</hi> But
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:47497:226"/>for his bodily Geſture, he lifted not up his Head, or his Face to Heaven, which is an expreſſion of greateſt hope: nor did he lift up his Hands to Heaven, or ſpread them abroad, which is alſo a ſolemne ſigne of ſpirituall rejoycing. Nay he did not ſo much as lift up his hands in a meane degree. Which <hi>Tertullian</hi> adviſeth us to do. He lift them not up at all, but let them fall, or hang down, as almoſt out of hope, or perhaps beat his breaſt with them. I think I may alſo truly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre hence, he did not lift up his very voyce to heaven: but with <hi>Anna,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.13. ſpake in his heart: his lips only moved, but his voyce was not heard, his ſorrowfull ſpirit pouted out his ſoule before the Lord, in the language of the heart, as in a ſilent murmure. He did not ſo much as lift up his eyes, much leſſe his voyce: ſo that any man could heare it, or know it. If Chriſt, God and Man, had not related it, we had not known it. Not ſo much as his eyes. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is ſooner performed than the lifting up of the eyes: Nothing eaſier diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched; Nature inclining us to it; and God framing our countenance to that end.

                        <p>The Publican offered violence to Nature by his reſolute dejectednes. God would have man look up; the Publican would not ſo much as lift up his eyes. Foure-footed beaſts have ſeven muſcles in their eyes; Man hath but ſix. Man is not hindred from looking upward. But that ſeventh muſcle is found only in ſuch beaſts, <hi>quae prona terram ſpectant,</hi> which look downright to the earth, (ſaith <hi>Laurentius in his Historia Anatomica,</hi> 11.5.) The firſt muſcle of the eye lifteth up the eye; and from his office, is called <hi>Attollens, &amp; Superbus,</hi> (ſaith the ſame <hi>Laurentius</hi>) who alſo addeth, that the eyes are called by the <hi>Hebrews Oogen,</hi> which ſignifieth High, and Lofty; to put us always in mind to contemplate High and Lofty things.</p>
                        <p>It is not ſaid in the ſingular, He would not lift up an eye to Heaven; but His eyes. God hath ſo created and framed the eyes of men, that naturally what below, or on the right hand, or on the left hand, or directly forward, ſo doth the other; though the muſcles ſerve to move the eyes on every ſide. But if one eye did look upward, and the other downward, the object would appeare double, and the ſight be uncertaine. Therefore to perfect the ſenſe of ſeeing, both move to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and alike; and moſt harmoniouſly conſort to the equall beholding of the ſame object. Yet if the eye in the ſingular be uſed (as it is full often) it doth not denote a ſeverall operation of one eye, different from the work of the other: but two are accounted as one, becauſe the effects of both are only one, and the ſame.</p>
                        <p>The eye-lids (though in men the upper only moveth) are two, and are ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; Birds have only one eye-lid moving in the lower part. Foure-footed beaſts have only the upper eye-lid. The higher eye-lid is greater in Men; the lower eye-lid is greater in Birds. In Men the higher eye-lid moveth both upward and downward, the lower moveth not, nor needeth move. And yet the higher only moving, they are called <hi>palpebrae,</hi> eye-lids. Contrary, the conjoyned and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible rowling, or moving of both eyes, is aſcribed as the operation of one eye in particular, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.52. <hi>in the twinckling of an eye;</hi> though they twinckle both together. <hi>Job</hi> 24.15. <hi>The eye of the Adulterer.</hi> And <hi>Jeremy</hi> 13.17. <hi>Mine eye ſhall weep:</hi> Yet both the Adulterers eyes are equally ſinfull.

His head in the ſingular, were waters in the plurall; and his eyes in the plurall, were a fountaine in the ſingular. Perhaps, this fountaine of teares deſcended ſo faſt upon the poore mortified Publican, that hee would not, becauſe ſo conveniently hee could not lift up his eyes to Heaven, drenched in his own teares.</p>

                        <p>The diverſity of opinions is very great. Some think that from the adoring of men, and the bodily proſtration to them, true Adoration of God is transferred to the mind. Others more probably, and ſenſibly, thus. When the great Heroës, and good benefactors to mankind did live, they were in great eſteeme, honored of all, and worſhipped above others, Kneeled unto, Kiſſed, Worſhipped, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored; yea when they were dead, the ſurviving did continue to their Images and Statues that reverence, which their perſons enjoyed in their lives. <hi>Many knees kneeled to Baal, and many mouths Kiſſed him;</hi> 1 Kings 19.18.</p>
                        <p>Even men have kneeled to men. <hi>Cornelius fell down at Peters feet, and worſhipped him,</hi> Acts 10.25. <hi>The Captaine fell on his knees before Eliah, and beſought him,</hi> 2 King. 1.13. <hi>The Shunamite fell at Eliſha's feet, and bowed her ſelfe to the ground;</hi> 2 King. 4.37. <hi>Eſther</hi> 8.3. <hi>She fell down at the Kings feet, and beſought him with teares.

                        <p>In Thankeſgivings, and Bleſſings, they ordinarily ſtood up, with lifted hands and eyes to Heaven.</p>
                        <p>And <hi>Salomon ſtood, and bleſſed all the Congregation of Iſrael, with a loud voyce.</hi> 1 King. 8.55. <hi>The Levites were to ſtand every morning, and evening to thanke and prayſe the Lord.</hi> 1 Chro. 23.30. <hi>The Phariſee ſtood, and prayed</hi> (Luke 18.11.) <hi>thus within himſelfe, Lord, I thanke thee.

                        <p>Variety of Geſtures according to the variety of Affaires, is not only commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, but neceſſary. He who made all things in number, weight, and meaſure, will proportion his Behaviour, and Geſture to devout harmonious holineſſe; who ordereth all things ſweetly; and hath commanded that we do all things orderly: his deportment was correſpondent to ſuch heavenly myſteries.</p>
                        <p>Any fixed Geſture is not eſſentiall to a Supper: nor eſſentially contrariant to it. It is the Feaſting makes the Supper, not the Geſture; and in ſome regard, it may be ſaid, The Supper makes the Feaſting; and juſt Occaſion Leadeth all, and Guideth all.</p>

Some do adde, with Hands ſpread abroad, and Feet diſperſed farre aſunder. But I want proofe for their ſtriding feet; though there is proofe enough for expanded hands in Adoration.</p>
                        <p>The Fift and higheſt and moſt devouted part was Prayer, both as they lay Proſtrate; and when they Roſe again on their Knees; and when they prayed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain Standing Upright.</p>
                        <p>Kneeling betokened fearefull Humility: Proſtration on the Ground, the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbole of Devotion, if I may ſo call it. Riſing again, ſignified an undaunted Hope, or hoping Charity; Standing prepared a man for Prayſing, and Thanking of God by an unfeined Faith.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Jacobus de Valentia ſuper Pſal.</hi> 104, <hi>Hac habent ſe per ordinem;</hi> Theſe things are thus in their right order. Firſt to Reverence or Revere, is to think of ſomewhat better in another, than we find in our ſelves. To Honour it, is to have an high conceit of the party for that Good. Then followeth Prayſe to commend the thing honored. After it, we do as it were Glorifie it by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Encomiums, and Laudatories. To Confeſſe, is to Affirme before men, that God is Lord of all things. To Adore, is to Worſhip the Honored, Reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and Glorified God, for his excellent Omnipotency, and Holineſſe; and ſetting all other hopes aſide, wholly to ſubmit himſelfe unto Him; and this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth only to God. So <hi>Valentia</hi> maketh Adoration containe within it ſelfe All the other Steps, and Degrees. In that his opinion, there is much Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incidency of matter.</p>
                        <p>Rather therefore thus:</p>
                        <p>Reverence doth eye directly the Excellency of a perſon: and as one is more, or leſſe excellent; ſo is the Reverence more or leſſe. In which regard, it being certaine, that Chriſt knowing the Excellency of his Father, more than other men did, or do, Revered, or Reverenced him more than other men do.</p>
                        <p>Veneration reſideth not in the ſoule alone, but ſheweth outward good reſpects to the things Venerable; implying, and including a Civill, and excluding a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and Superſtitious deportment.</p>
                        <p>Worſhip is one Degree higher, more Obedient, more Pious, more Devout, both Inwardly, and Outwardly.</p>
                        <p>Adoration is the Higheſt ſtep, including all the reſt within its verge: produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, firſt an Act of the Intellect, by which we apprehend and know the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminency of the thing Adorated; firmely beleeving that he is all Good, and no Good commeth, but from him, and without him we can have no Good. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly an Act of the Will, by which we inwardly bow and ſubject our ſelves, and are ready to do any thing inward or outward in teſtimoniall of its Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, and our ſubmiſſive ſubjection. Thirdly, Adoration riſeth not only in a proneneſſe, and obſequious intentions, but produceth the bodily Acts of Bending,
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:47497:227"/>Kneeling, Proſtration, or any other honorary and holy geſture. I ſtand not on ſtrictneſſe of tearmes, but uſe them promiſcuouſly.</p>
                        <p>I conclude thus, as moſt agreeable with conveniency, reaſon, and devotion. When our bleſſed Saviour prayed at any time, whilſt this holy work was in hand (as I doubt not but he prayed) he may be thought to kneele, yea on both his knees, as he was wont. Sure I am, S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Timoth. 4.4. &amp; 5. verſes, ſaith, <hi>Every creature is good, if it be received with Thankeſgiving: For it is ſanctified by the word of God and prayer.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If at ordinary meales, Prayer and Thankeſgiving were uſually conjoyned, to ſanctifie their meate; we may not imagine, that in ſo ſacred a banquer, Chriſt did give Thankes without Prayer. Though Chriſts prayer or praying be not expreſſed. And yet, <hi>Quod ſubanditur, &amp; ſubintelligitur, non omittitur:</hi> That which is underſtood, is not omitted. The great connexion and conjunction, of Prayer with Thankeſgiving; and Thankeſgiving with Prayer, ſheweth that they are almoſt all one. What the Apoſtle called Thankeſgiving, 1 <hi>Timoth.</hi> 4.3 &amp; 4. ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: he calleth Prayer, verſe 5. <hi>Qui unum norit, ambo norit,</hi> Know one, know both.</p>
                        <p>When we pray, there are Two Motives, though in ſome degree contrary, yet alwayes conjoyned, Feare and Hope. The fruits of Feare, are, the humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation both of ſoule and body; with caſting downe of our Eyes; with Smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Breaſt, like the Publican, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.13. With teares confeſſing out ſinnes, and humble petition, <hi>Lord be mercifull to me a ſinner.</hi> When our prayers are ended, and we reconciled, the geſtures of Hope are theſe, or the like: Ariſing from the ground; Lifting up both of hearts, eyes, and hands to heaven. Chriſt himſelfe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.41. <hi>Lift up his Eyes to his Father.</hi> Without ſome kinde of Feare, we need not pray: and without ſome Hope to obtaine, none would pray.</p>

                        <p>BEfore I examine what particular Poſture, Geſture, or Behaviour Chriſt uſed, when he Received and Adminiſtred the holy Euchariſt; I muſt needs ſay ſomewhat more of Adoration in Generall.

                        <p>The Heroes, and Semidei, the Heröicall Ones, and Half-gods, were ſometimes Men with great and vaſt bodies (ſaith <hi>Arnobius adverſus Gentes, lib.</hi> 2. toward the end, <hi>pag.</hi> 119.) <hi>Trithemius</hi> mentioneth <hi>Secundeos,</hi> which ſucceſſively rule the world. May not famous Men and Princes be meant thereby? Certainly, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Gods were very Men; both the ſame <hi>Arnobius</hi> and <hi>Minutius Foelix in Octavio</hi> doe declare it; mentioning their places of Birth, Countryes, Parents, Dwellings, Deaths, and Burialls. <hi>Alexander</hi> wrote to his Mother, that the Prieſts of <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> for feare of his power, had revealed this ſecret, <hi>De Diis hominibus;</hi> That their Gods were but men. More particularly, <hi>Tertullian in Apologetico,</hi> and the ſaid <hi>Minutius Foelix,</hi> write of Saturne (from <hi>Neros</hi> and <hi>Caſſias</hi> his Hiſtory; from <hi>Thallus</hi> and <hi>Diodorus</hi>) that Saturne was a man that fled from Crete for feare of his Sonne, and came to Italy, and was hoſted by <hi>Janus,</hi> and being <hi>Graeculus &amp; politus,</hi> a neat Greeke, did teach them many fine new devices. <hi>Homo igitur uti<expan>

But of this more hereafter.</p>
                        <p>That they did preſerve the memory of theſe dead men, by making Statues, Images, and Reſemblances of them, is moſt evident, and beyond deniall. The ſame <hi>Minutius Foelix</hi> divinely reproveth their manner of deifying men; And it
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:47497:228"/>ſeemes he tooke it from <hi>Eſay</hi> 44.10. &amp;c. His diſcourſe is thus: When is a God borne?

                        <p>WHen their Gods were now borne, and acknowledged as conſecrated, they fell unto ſeverall kindes of worſhipping them. That they did Lift up their Eyes to their Idols, is proved, <hi>Ezechiel</hi> 18.10. &amp;c. <hi>And they bleſſed their Idols,</hi> Eſay 66.3.

                        <p>The Image of <hi>Iſis</hi> was on an Aſſes backe; the people kneeled and fell downe to it; the Aſſe grew proud, as if the Honour had been done to him; The people (which was a greater Aſſe) ſpake to his brother Aſſe, <hi>Non tibi, ſed Religioni;</hi> We worſhip not thee, but <hi>Iſis;</hi> And yet it ſtood with more reaſon, to worſhip the Aſſe, which had ſenſe, rather than the Image which had no ſence.

                        <p>See <hi>Aulus Gellius</hi> 20.1. who hath that Law of the Twelve Tables at large.

For (ſaith he) many debtors are adjudged to their Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and bound, or impriſoned: But that ever any was cut into pieces, and each Creditor had ſeverall gobbets, or portions, I never heard or read; though the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor of the Law ran ſo. If there were more Creditors, to whom the indebted man was adjudged, the Law permitted them to cut in pieces and divide the body of the Debtor among them.</p>

                           <item>5. Let me adde. They then lifted up both their Eyes, and Hands ſpread abroad to Heaven.

                        <p>Nor did they Kiſſe the Lips only of their Idols, and their Mouths; but both the Fore-parts, and the Hinder parts, and their Shoulders, the Cheeks, the backe of the Hand, even the very Feet. See <hi>Ritterbuſius ad Salvianum, pag.</hi> 379. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they might kiſſe ſome other Hinder parts in humiliation. And I do verily think they left not the Knees unkiſſed.</p>

                        <p>AMong men, if <hi>Perſians</hi> of equal Degree, did meet, they Kiſſed one anothers Lips. If a Superior met an Inferior, he gave the Inferior his Cheeks to kiſſe.

                        <p>The ſtory of <hi>Polyperchon</hi> falleth in here very fittly: A <hi>Perſian</hi> worſhipping <hi>Alexander,</hi> fell on his face before him, and with his chin touched the ground:

                           <hi>Polyperchon</hi> in a floute, exhorted the <hi>Perſian</hi> to ſhake his chin luſtily againſt the ground: <hi>Alexander</hi> thereupon drew <hi>Polyperchon</hi> from the banqueting bed, and tumbled him down, and arietated him to the earth, and made his head knock the ground: and bitterly taunted him ſaying: Now <hi>Polyperchon,</hi> thou ſeeſt thy ſelfe do that, which even now thou didſt laugh at in another.

                        <p>Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> very probably addeth, It was called Adoration, or they were ſaid to Adore; <hi>Quòd ad Ora, ſive ad Os manum admovebant;</hi> becauſe they moved their Hands to their Mouths; or rather the Fore-finger joyned to the Thumb, as he before explained it.

                        <p>One reaſon, why they did both Bend and Kiſſe, may be, becauſe both Head, and Mouth with it, did ſtoop down toward the Hand; and the Hand did mount up to meet the Mouth. The joynt correſpondence, the concurring to the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, maketh the Senſe appliable, either to Hand, or Lips.

So farre <hi>Cerda.</hi> I am now almoſt at an end. <hi>Wiſdome</hi> 14.15. There is a ſtory of a Father afflicted with untimely mourning. When he had made an Image of his Childe, ſoone taken away, now honoured him as a God, which was then a dead man, and delivered to thoſe that were under him, Rites and Ceremonies. See farther in the 16, 17, and 20 &amp; 21 verſes. The Father here pointed at, was one <hi>Syrophanes</hi> (ſaith <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cot</hi> on the place) and he had this from the Maſter of the Scholaſticall Hiſtory: From <hi>Fulgentius Mythologiar. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 1.

                        <p>HOLCOT yet proceedeth; The Maſter of the Scholaſticall Hiſtory, telleth another Story of the Originall of Idols. <hi>Ninus</hi> King of Aſſyria (when <hi>Belus</hi> his Father was dead) made the Image of his Father, which was an
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:47497:233"/>
                           <hi>Aſylum,</hi> a Sanctuary to faulty perſons. Whereupon Men gave divine Honours to that Statue. Others likewiſe dedicated Images to their dead friends. <hi>Gregory</hi> hath this Story on <hi>Luke</hi> 11.15. Nor is there repugnancy in theſe Stories, ſaith <hi>Holcot;</hi> becauſe Idolatry had divers Inventors; and the Booke of <hi>Wiſdome</hi> inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in the Egyptian Idolatry, as being the moſt, and worſt. Likewiſe in other parts of the world, as he there evinceth at large, Idolatry ſprung from divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther motives: and Adoration with it, ſay I. It is moſt certaine, The worſhip ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to falſe gods, was called Adoration: and it is very likely, becauſe they did <hi>Orare, &amp; Orare ad Deos,</hi> it was termed with a little and eaſie inverſion, <hi>Adorare.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I conclude; Since men of Great Renowne were before Kings: and Kings were Adored whilſt they breathed; and preceded their Counterfeits, Pictures or Images, the Statues had Adoration derived unto Them from the Adoration of thoſe eminent Men: who being but Men, were by Men made ſuch Gods as they were, for doing of good: and for thoſe mens ſakes, and in memory of them, were their Semblances, or Portraytures, and Statues made, Adorned, Prayed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to or Adored. <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.26. <hi>Then began men to call On the Name of the Lord;</hi> or, <hi>to call themſelves By the name of the Lord;</hi> as it is in the Margine of our laſt tranſlation.</p>
                        <p>It is true indeed, that ſome learned men, and Maſter <hi>Selden</hi> among them, <hi>De Diis Syris</hi> in his <hi>Prolegomena, cap.</hi> 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 28. read it, <hi>Tunc coeptum est profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nari in invocando nomine Jehovae;</hi> becauſe (ſay they) <hi>Chalal</hi> is interpreted both to Begin, and to Profane. But the reaſon is ſhallow, and may be thus retorted; Becauſe <hi>Chalal</hi> is interpreted, both to Begin and to Prophane; it cannot ſignifie, <hi>Coeptum eſt Profanari;</hi> but either, <hi>Coeptum est,</hi> or <hi>Profanatum eſt.</hi> That <hi>Chalal</hi> ſignifies ſometimes to Profane, is confeſſed on all ſides.

From whence Authors doe gather (ſaith he) that <hi>Enos</hi> did inſtitute ſome particular Worſhip, and Higher and Better than the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the people. If he meane of the people that were of the curſed ſeed of <hi>Cain,</hi> I will confeſſe it. If he meane <hi>Enos,</hi> as a Patriarch or chiefe head of a Family, inſtructed the people, and preſcribed them their Duties, both to Beleeve and to Practiſe; and that the people did not right to regulate or frame a Religion to Themſelves, or their Superiours; I will ſay, as he ſaith. Let ignorant, preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and frantick Rebels, who will Guide both King and Kirke, think of this. I ſay, God defend me from a Religion compiled and made by the Ignorants, or by the Vulgar: though two or three factious Superintendents, as <hi>Thomas Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, Buchanan, Knox,</hi> or the like, doe either lead them, or be led by them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Bellarmine</hi> citeth <hi>Waldenſis,</hi> as one of the Authors: yet he is a party, not a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall witneſſe, and more ſuſpected than <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe, as living in more ignorant times. Yea <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe might as well have ſaid, that <hi>Adam's</hi> and <hi>Eve's</hi> manner of life, before they had any Childe, did adumbrate, effigiate, or afford a patterne or patrociny, for the ſolitary life of the married Hermites: for ſome ſuch they have had, and one of late.</p>
                        <p>If <hi>Enos</hi> did prefigure then a Monaſticall life, it was of married Monkes alſo; <hi>For he begate ſonnes and daughters eight hundred and fifteene yeares,</hi> Gen. 5.10.</p>

Laſtly; If it muſt be read, <hi>Profanatum eſt nomen Domini,</hi> as is poſſibly verifia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; Then from this place no Monkery can be adumbrated.</p>
                        <p>Others are in Another extreame, and gather from hence, That now was the publique Breaking-in of Idolatry; and Gods Name now began to be propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. So farre was that time from eſtabliſhing any extraordinary way of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſervice of God in their judgements. And therefore they reade it, as I ſaid before; <hi>Tunc coeptum est profanari in invocando nomine Iehovae.</hi> But, I ſay, Firſt for the Reading, they tranſlate the Hebrew amiſſe; for <gap reason="foreign">

                           <hi>Hochal</hi> cannot be expounded, both <hi>Coeptum est,</hi> and <hi>Profanari</hi> alſo in the ſame place; though in ſeverall places it may ſignifie, ſometimes the one, and ſometimes the other; and perhaps both together, if <hi>Hochal</hi> were doubled, or repeated. Maſter <hi>Selden</hi> in the place above cited, ſaith; Divers Rabbins have read it, <hi>Tunc profanatum eſt in invocando nomine Jehovae;</hi> where he might have obſerved, that <hi>coeptum eſt,</hi> was, and muſt be left out. <hi>Vatablus</hi> averreth, that another learned Jew expoundeth it, <hi>Tunc Inquinatum, ſive profanatum eſt nomen Domini;</hi> but <hi>Vatablus</hi> himſelfe rendreth it beſt of all; <hi>Tunc coeptum est Invocari nomen Jehovae.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Profanatum est nomen Domini,</hi> may poſſibly be a good reading. <hi>Coeptum eſt, Invocari,</hi> is farre more probable, in my judgement. But ſingle <hi>Hochal</hi> cannot be rendred <hi>Coeptum eſt profanari;</hi> if it were true, that it might be ſo at large juſtifia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly expounded from the ſenſe.</p>
                        <p>The Interlineary hath it literally, and truely; <hi>Tunc coeptum est ad invocandum in nomine Domini.</hi> Indeed in the Margin, it is <hi>Invocari nomen, vel pollui;</hi> where the word <gap reason="foreign">

                           <hi>Likra,</hi> is made appliable either to Invocation, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation. But the word is tortured; and though the Interlineary cites the reading ſo, it doth not therefore approve it. But <gap reason="foreign">

                           <hi>Hochal</hi> is rendred moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, <hi>Coeptum eſt;</hi> and in ſome other place, <hi>Inquinatum est:</hi> yet it doth not, nor cannot in this place, comprehend within its ſignification any of Theſe two readings; either <hi>Coeptum est Invocari,</hi> or <hi>Coeptum eſt Profanari,</hi> as I ſaid before. I ſay, <hi>Hochal</hi> by it ſelfe cannot ſignifie ſo.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, I, for my part, will adhere to the tranſlation of our Church, who have it in the Biſhops Bibles: Then began they to make Invocation in the Name of the Lord; or in the laſt Tranſlation, as is before recited. God grant me to avoyd unneceſſary crochets or ſtraines of ſingularity with any earneſtneſſe; by follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the major part, and by uſing the commoneſt notions of the words.</p>
                        <p>Though the firſt Edition of <hi>Tremelius</hi> had it, as <hi>Druſius</hi> ſaith; <hi>Tunc coeptum eſt Profanari:</hi> the later hath it, as a palinody, ſay I, <hi>Tunc coeptum eſt Invocari;</hi> And truely I was glad, that after I had uttered and pend my ſetled ſingle judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I found <hi>Druſius</hi> on the place concurring with me. <hi>Si Hochal hoc loco ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficat coeptum eſt, non ſignificat Profanatum eſt; &amp; contra, ſi ſignificat profanatum eſt, non ſignificat Coeptum eſt.</hi> If <hi>Hochal</hi> in this place doe ſignifie, <hi>They Began:</hi> it doth not ſignifie, <hi>They Prophaned:</hi> and contrarily, If it ſignifie here, <hi>They Prophaned;</hi> it cannot ſignifie, <hi>They Began;</hi> So <hi>Druſius</hi> hath it in his Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, <hi>Ad difficiliora loca Geneſeos Cap.</hi> 15. <hi>pag.</hi> 30. where he handles the words more at large.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, concerning the matter it ſelfe, which neerer concerneth the point in queſtion; Whether Worſhipping of Idols, preceded Worſhipping of Kings, or Men of Renowne; and ſo Kings came to be Worſhipped, becauſe Idols had been ſo; or rather contrarily, that Idols had their Worſhip from the preceding Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Kings, and Eminent people? Let me follow <hi>Aquinas,</hi> ſaying, 2 <hi>â</hi> 2<hi>ae quaeſtione</hi> 94. <hi>Art.</hi> 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. Idolatry was not before the Flood, for ſo his words, <hi>(inprima aetate)</hi> are to be underſtood, as appeareth by the ſecond objection, <hi>In ſecunda aetate. Idololatria legitur eſſe adinventa, vel à Nembeoth, qui (ut dicitur) cogebat homines Ignem Adorare: vel à Nino, qui imaginem patris ſui Beli Adorari fecit;</hi> And both thoſe were After the Flood: There was no Idolatry in regard of the freſh memory of the Worlds Creation; ſo that the knowledge of the true
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:47497:234"/>God, did flouriſh in their minds (ſaith <hi>Aquinas</hi>) though they abounded in other ſinnes, ſay I. The affections of <hi>Cain,</hi> and his deſcendents, were moſt perverſe: but their underſtandings were not ſo darkned, but they remembred the Creator of all things; with whom <hi>Cain</hi> had perſonall conference, (if I may ſo ſay) as well as <hi>Adam</hi> had. If you ſharpen an objection, that within a while after the Flood the people forgat both the gracious Creation, and their as juſt as terrible inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and fell to Idolatry, and ſo they might in the law of nature. As quickly I anſwer; Though they had ſome few good men after the Flood, to live among them, as <hi>Noah, Sem,</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to keepe them from Idolatry: yet neither did the righteous men live ſo long, nor were ſo many, or neare the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as the firſt Patriarks were, or as our <hi>Enos,</hi> who lived nine hundred and five yeares, nor as <hi>Seth,</hi> who lived nine hundred and twelve yeares; much leſſe as <hi>Adam,</hi> who lived nine hundred and thirty yeares. About ſix hundred yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Enos</hi> was borne, as ſome ſay; <hi>Enos</hi> lived with <hi>Adam</hi> ſix hundred ninety five yeares (ſaith <hi>Salianus;</hi>) yea ſome account, that <hi>Adam</hi> lived within a hundred and thirty yeares of the birth of <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> ten yeares longer than her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. Theſe propagated the true Religion, and ſomewhat reſtrained the ſtigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized <hi>Cain,</hi> and his irreligious poſterity, from extremity of ſinning, by their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lives, ſanctified precepts, and divine both reprehenſions and exhortations. Indeed <hi>Cyril</hi> in the beginning of his third Booke <hi>de Geneſi,</hi> relateth, that <hi>Enos</hi> was called a God, and held a God for his admirable vertue and incredible juſtice. <hi>Theodoret</hi> proceedeth <hi>quaeſtione</hi> 47 <hi>in Geneſin;</hi> By his kinſmen was <hi>Enos</hi> called a God, from whence even thoſe that were borne of him, and other holy men, were called the Sonnes of God. It ſeemeth to be confirmed by <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.2. <hi>The Sonnes of God ſaw the daughters of Men:</hi> So <hi>Adam</hi> was called <hi>the Sonne of God, Luk.</hi> 3.38. So Kings and their Officers are termed <hi>the Sonnes of the moſt High, Pſal.</hi> 82.6. and Chriſtians are called <hi>the Sonnes of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.1. and <hi>are the Sonnes of God,</hi> verſe 2. But none of this was Idolatry, nor did they make theſe men falſe Gods, nor worſhip their Statues, for they were called Gods no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than in the Scripture Magiſtrates and Great Men are called Gods, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82.6. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.34. <hi>I ſaid yee are Gods.</hi>

As for example; <hi>Abraham</hi> called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the name of <hi>Iehova.</hi> The meaning may be; <hi>Abraham</hi> called on the name of him, whom I knew to be <hi>Iehova,</hi> though <hi>Abraham</hi> knew him not by that name, but by ſome other. Again, where it is, I am <hi>Iehova</hi> (in the conference with <hi>Abraham</hi>) <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote in the language of the later and better relation, though long before God might ſpeake to <hi>Abraham</hi> in other words to that effect. For <hi>Moſes</hi> doth not, would not contradict <hi>Moſes;</hi> And the truth being but one, <hi>Abraham</hi> did not know the name <hi>Iehova</hi> before, which was firſt revealed to <hi>Moſes;</hi> and therefore firſt ſpoken by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and applied by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the firſt times ſo ſoone as Man was created, and ſo continually diſperſed into the Hiſtory of the other Patriarcks; <hi>Moſes</hi> delighting in his prerogative of firſt knowing the the name of <hi>Iehova;</hi> as Lawyers may more eloquently utter the Laws of the 12 Tables which were in rude Latin long before, in the more refined, and fuller ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of latter times: Or like Hiſtorians, and Poëts who aſcribe the name of <hi>Iove,</hi> and <hi>Ioves</hi> words and deeds, to the firſt beginning of times; though <hi>Iove</hi> had no being till after the Flood of <hi>Noah;</hi> and therefore no name. So <hi>Moſes</hi> might write according to the moſt cleare Revelations of his time, what was done, and ſaid, in other termes not ſo energeticall, long before to the Patriarcks.</p>
                        <p>If this pleaſe you not; what ſay you to a ſecond way? May not the words be read by way of Interrogation, which is as good as a ſtrong and vehement affirmation? By the name of <hi>Iehova,</hi> was not I known to them? As if he had ſaid; yes, certainly I was; as may be ſeen in their particular ſtories and paſſages of their time. And I have elſo eſtabliſhed <hi>my Covenant with them, Exod.</hi> 6.4. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by that name Jehova, Gen.</hi> 15.1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, verſes. For I pray you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, God here ſpeaketh not to diminiſh the reputation of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob:</hi> but to the great glory of their names and perſons, with whom firſt hee eſtabliſhed the Covenant made with them for the Jews. And therefore Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of God, or neſciency of his great Name, cannot be handſomely aſcribed to thoſe Patriarcks in this place, where the knowledge and ratification of Gods Covenant, and Gods familiarity with them, are reckoned as their glorious priviledges above all other men of thoſe times.</p>
                        <p>Did not <hi>Abraham</hi> ſee Chriſts day a far off? Did he not rejoyce at the ſight of it? Was God the God of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> above other men? and they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed as the Living, and not as Dead; &amp; ſhall we reſt in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, and eat and drink with <hi>Abraham,</hi> in the Kingdom of Heaven; than which preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, none ever had greater, and more, except our bleſſed Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who alſo came of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and was promiſed particularly to
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:47497:235"/>
                           <hi>Abraham,</hi> that in his ſeed, that is, as the Apoſtle ſaith, not in his ſeeds, but in Chriſt, all the Nations of the World ſhould be bleſſed: and ſhall <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> be ignorant of the name <hi>Jehova,</hi> which both <hi>Caine</hi> knew at firſt, and every Jew, and Chriſtian now knows? I cannot ſo undervalew thoſe Patriarcks <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jorum Gentium.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Beſides, though not a Sentence, not a Word, not a Letter, not a jot of Scripture, can now be loſt or periſh: yet the note of an Interrogation, or a Comma, a Colon, a Mark, or a Pauſe might be omitted long ſince. For was not all Scripture written without both points, and vowels at firſt? If you ſay, the marke of an Interrogation being wanting, leadeth us to perplexities, to diverſity, yea contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of ſenſes. I anſwer. Do not full many words in the Hebrew Bible ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie contrary things, exciting our ſtudious minds to a ſearch of the moſt probable matters, and meaning, whilſt the truth is known to God alone? Even thus might it be with this paſſage. Where the note of an Interrogation might either be wholly omitted at firſt, or caſually unobſetved, and left out by the firſt Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers, or Tranſlators; and this might lead men into Ignorance ever ſince; and yet no imperfection is to be imputed unto Gods Word; nor is it blameable for any deficiency. And therefore I conclude, according to the Rules of <hi>Ariſtotle, Top.</hi> 6. <hi>cap, ult.</hi> Let this expoſition ſtand, and be beleeved, till better be inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and come in place. And then let the cleareſt light of truth have his due; that is perſwaſion. And let the leſſe yeeld, and obey the greater.</p>
                        <p>If you expect authorities averring, that Idolatry was not before the Flood; I refer you to the learned <hi>Salianus,</hi> in divers places, eſpecially in <hi>anno Mundi</hi> 250, and to the learned <hi>Scholia ibid.</hi> who citeth for me, and for the negative, <hi>Cyril Alexandrinus contra Julianum libro primo. Irenaeus</hi> 5.29. and divers others. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſuch, whom my wearineſſe commandeth me to omit, that I may returne from extravagances to the right way, and method propounded by me. And ſo becauſe there was no Idolatry before the Flood: and Kings, at leaſt eminent men of high renown, and worth, were long before the times of the Flood, or Idolatry: I conclude, Kings, Princes, Dukes, and other men of venerable account for their goodneſſe, in making Cities, governing of Nations, and founding Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weales, had not the beginnings of their Adoration from the worſhip exhibited to Idols, Statues, Images, or Pictures: but rather, thoſe <hi>Simulacra</hi> were Adored, becauſe they were the repreſentations of Kings, Princes, or other people, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, and revered; who both in their lives, and after their deaths, were Adored. And yet to make the beſt interpretation that I may, of Mr. <hi>Seldens</hi> words; whom for his depth, and variety of learning I admire: Let my conſent run along thus far by his ſide; That the later Kings, and Heroës might perhaps have had their Adorations from ſome kind of Adoration derived from Idoles; and yet the firſt Idols had their primitive Adoration from the Adoration of Kings, and other people of eſteem, which were before Idolatry.</p>
                        <p>When Chriſt Worſhipped and Adored God, as doubtleſſe he did full often, I think, He fell down on his Face. No Geſture could be more convenient at the celebration of the holy Sacrament. For we cannot think otherwiſe, but that Chriſt uſed almoſt all poſſible meanes to make the Apoſtles attentive to him: and ſtirred them up, to the conſideration of ſo ſtupendious myſteries, that they might be better prepared to the holy receiving of them. Among Geſtures exciting, and raiſing up of Devotion, the falling down upon ones Face, is moſt forcible, either in ſeeing it ſo done by others, or in practiſing it our ſelves. The dejection and proſtration of the body, is the elevation of the ſoule, and a meanes to ſanctifie and quicken the ſpirit.</p>
                        <p>When he took the bread, and gave thankes (for thankes hee gave) <hi>Luke</hi> 22.19. I cannot think otherwiſe but he lifted up his Eyes, and Hands to Heaven. So did he in leſſer matters; for when he multiplied the five loaves, <hi>he looked up to Heaven, and bleſſed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his Diſciples.</hi> And can we
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:47497:235"/>now think, He looked on the Earth, and not up to Heaven, when he gave Thanks and bleſſed the Food of life for us?</p>
                        <p>When he brake the bread, and gave it, It is likelieſt he ſtood on his Feet, and might move from one to another; or reach it to every one ſeverally. So did the <hi>Pater familias,</hi> or chiefe of the Feaſt among the Jews ſtand, and diſtribute the bread at their ſollemne meetings as the Rabbins affirme.</p>
                        <p>When hee conſecrated the Bread, ſaying; <hi>Take, eat, this is my Body, which is given for you; Do this in remembrance of me,</hi> Luke 22.19. and hallowed the Cup with its proper conſecration: His countenance was divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Sacred Euchariſt, and his Diſciples: Somtimes he beheld one, ſomtimes another: as the matter required. He viewed the bread, when he began to ſay, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> which is broken, or given; When he proceeded, <hi>It is given,</hi> or <hi>broken for you,</hi> he earneſtly beheld his Apoſtles, and the whole Church in Them, <hi>Idealiter,</hi> Likewiſe when he ſaid, concerning the <hi>Cup, Drinke yee all of it, &amp;c.</hi> His Eyes paſſed along with his Words, his Words with his Heart: viewing the varied objects, as was meet, flitting, and moving from the Apoſtles, when he commanded, <hi>All of you drink;</hi> or <hi>Drinke you All:</hi> But when he added, <hi>Drink ye all of it;</hi> for <hi>this is my blood of the new Testament;</hi> it cannot bee, but hee earneſtly beheld the conſecrated Wine, or his own Blood.</p>
                        <p>All this I likewiſe ſuppoſe to be done by our Heavenly Saviour, as he ſtood on his Feet; And this doth the Church, or ought to do, imitating him, and fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his commandement. <hi>Do this in remembrance of me:</hi> which he ſpake not only of the Bread, and the forme of its conſecration, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.19. and perhaps of Identity of Geſture: but alſo of the Cup, and the Conſecrating of the Wine in its proper forme, as himſelfe had done, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.25. And either in Heaven, or from Heaven taught his Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul.</hi> Whilſt each of them did eat, he beheld the Eater ſeverally: and when they drank <hi>All</hi> of it, (as they <hi>All drank of it, Marke</hi> 4.23.) So he beheld them eſpecially, and ſingly one after another.</p>

                        <p>Let us conſider the Actions in order in the ſame manner as Chriſt performed them.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>He tooke bread;</hi> and ſo the Cup: he might have bid them take it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as in the Second Supper he bade them <hi>Divide the wine among themſelves, Luke</hi> 22.17. But he himſelfe now <hi>Tooke the bread,</hi> and by <hi>Taking</hi> it, ſheweth he would do ſomewhat more by It, than by other bread, which he took not into his hands. So <hi>John</hi> 6.5. <hi>Jeſus lift up his eyes: and he took the loaves, and when he had given thankes, he diſtributed to the Diſciples,</hi> ver. 11. <hi>So he took the ſeven loaves, and fiſhes, and gave thankes, and brake them, and gave them to the Diſciples, Mat.</hi> 15.36.</p>
                        <p>Neither did he ever take Any thing in a religious forme into his hands, but it was bettered, and changed from its old nature ſome way or other. <hi>Simeon tooke Chriſt up in his armes and bleſſed God, Luke</hi> 2.28. for Chriſt needed no bleſſing. <hi>Chriſt took a child into his armes, Mark</hi> 9.36. And ſome think this child was <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius,</hi> who ſaith of himſelfe, that he was <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, borne or carried of God. But whoſoever hee was, certainly he was bleſſed of Chriſt more than others, whom he took not into his armes. When little Children were brought to him that he might touch them, Chriſt was much diſpleaſed with his Diſciples, becauſe they rebuked them who brought them; he took the children up in his armes; but what followed? <hi>He put his hands upon them, and bleſſed them, Mark</hi> 10.16. If I ſhould ſay, that when Chriſt made a ſcourge of ſmall cords, <hi>John</hi> 2.15. <hi>and drove all the faulty ones out of the Temple,</hi> no doubt that ſcourge had more vertue than an ordinary whip. <hi>If vertue went out of him, when a woman touched but the hemme of his garment, Mat.</hi> 9.20. queſtionleſſe, when in a religious way he tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched other things, he imparted vertue to them. So when he took the bread, you cannot but think, <hi>He put his hands upon it, and bleſſed it:</hi> bleſſed it above other bread which he touched not. Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith expreſſely, <hi>He took bread, and bleſſed it, Mat.</hi> 26.26. So it is alſo <hi>Mark</hi> 14.22. confirmed with a back of ſteel. It is varied <hi>Luke</hi> 22.19. <hi>Chriſt took the bread, and gave thanks, and brake it.</hi> And this is alſo doubled or redoubled, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. <hi>&amp;c.

                           <hi>AFter he took bread, he bleſſed it, Mat.</hi> 26.26. What it is to bleſſe? All words, names, voices, and things whatſoever which are applied to God, are more ſignificant than if they be referred to ordinary matters. When God bleſſeth, he giveth, bequeatheth, exhibiteth bleſſings. He doth good, and proſpereth the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties bleſſed. Gods <hi>Benedicere,</hi> is his <hi>Benefacere;</hi> imparting to the creature ſome reall benefit, efficacious bleſſing, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.2. <hi>I will bleſſe thee, and make thy name great..</hi> That was one effect of Gods bleſſing; but many more concurred with that, both Temporall. <hi>The Lord hath bleſſed my Maſter greatly, and he is become great: he hath given him flocks, and heards, ſilver, and gold, &amp;c. Gen.</hi> 24.35. What need have we to cite more particulars? when <hi>God bleſſed Abrahaem in all things, ver.</hi> 1.

By the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth. Pſal.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Abraham</hi> became a bleſſing to us.

Laſtly, it is like alſo they did increaſe even in their mouthes, and as they did eat them. Nor were the five loave made more loaves, or the two fiſhes increaſed in number; for then it had been improperly ſaid, that they all did eat, and were filled with five loaves and two fiſhes, if the loaves and fiſhes were more in number: as if from every ſtalke ſeven eares came up full and good; ſo from every loafe more loaves did ariſe, and from every fiſh more fiſhes.

                        <p>As God Bleſſeth: ſo Chriſt Bleſſeth. For his Bleſſing never conſiſted in meer words, but was effectuall in operation, conveying reall good unto the bleſſed. For though the Bleſſing of the bread was not properly the Conſecration of his body; yet it was an antecedent Preparative; a diſpoſitive Adaptation: not void, or vaine, or inefficacious: perhaps accompanied with prayers, perhaps with thankſgiving, perhaps with both. The Benediction of Parents, though it be but a prayer moſt times, yet it returneth not empty; but many times imparteth
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:47497:238" rendition="simple:additions"/>bleſſedneſſe: yea, Alwayes if the Recipient be well prepared. The Sacerdotall Benediction is not Onely a plaine good prayer; but wholly, and altogether hath a certaine power and efficacy of the Key, Looſing and Abſolving, (ſaith <hi>Illirycus.</hi>) Who would have invocated the doctrine of the Keyes, if he could have found but a little hole Open, or a little crack or flaw? But Chriſts Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, as it was mighty in operation, ſo it conſiſted in part as well of Thankeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, as of Prayers.

                        <p>Chriſts Giving of Thankes when he adminiſtred the Sacrament, was Thankes to God alone, not to Men, not to the Sacrament: And the Benediction did not onely bleſſe God: but bleſſed the ſubject matter, the Bread, and the Wine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Cup: the Cup it ſelfe being ſaid to be bleſſed, by the Metaphor of <hi>continens pro contento.</hi> The elementall Sacramentals had an induing, ſome way or other, with heavenly vertue.</p>
                        <p>The Jewes had diſtinct Graces for their Suppers. And no doubt, Chriſt was more devout in Thankeſgiving to God, than the Jewes were. He is a Jew, who denieth this truth. Therefore Chriſts Thankeſgiving in the Celebration of the Euchariſt, was not an Ordinary Giving of Thankes, as is before all other meales: but more Divine, and Operatively energeticall, ſuting with ſo heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly myſteries.</p>
                        <p>Chriſts Benediction of the bread, was not principally the Conſecration of it, but a kinde of preparative prayer before the Conſecration.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Lyranus, Hugo, Innocentius,</hi> ſay, the Benediction was the Conſecration. <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dixit ipſum panem,</hi> ſaith <hi>Maldonate.</hi> Ambroſe, <hi>Hic eſt panis, quem Benedictio conſecravit:</hi> This is the bread conſecrated by the Bleſſing (ſaith he, <hi>in Libro de iis qui initiantur, cap.</hi> 9.) <hi>Barradius</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ambroſe</hi>) taketh <hi>Benedictionem Latè:</hi> and inferreth, If after Bleſſing Chriſt inſtituted the Sacrament, then the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing was not the Conſecration.</p>

                        <p>Though the manner of Chriſts Benediction be not recorded in Scripture, yet we cannot well thinke it was in words onely: Excluding all ſolemnity of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, denying his Ocular Elevation, rejecting the Impoſition of his Hands, which he was wont to doe in Benediction. <hi>He laid his Hands on little children and bleſſed them,</hi> Mark. 10.13. So did he in healing the ſicke, <hi>Mark.</hi> 6.5. <hi>He laid his Hand on a few ſicke folk, and healed them.</hi> So <hi>Luke</hi> 4.40.</p>
                        <p>Sure I am, that he lift up his Hands, when he Bleſſed his Apoſtles, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.50. And his Apoſtles were wont to conſecrate people to divine ſervices by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Hands. 1 <hi>Timoth.</hi> 5.22. <hi>Lay Hands ſodainly on no man.</hi> He doth not ſpeake in <hi>Senſu forenſi,</hi> of Laying on of hands; as he Laid his hands on me; that is, he ſtrooke me: But <hi>in ſenſu Eccleſiaſtico,</hi> as the Holy Spirit teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us, for Conſecration, as <hi>Timothy</hi> himſelfe was uſed, who received a gift by prophecy, <hi>With the Laying on of Hands,</hi> 1 Timoth. 4.14.</p>
                        <p>In the old Law they had diverſe Heave offrings, or Wave-offrings: As they did wave other things: So they did wave a loafe of bread, and a cake of oyled bread, and a wafer out of the basket of unleavened bread, <hi>Exodus</hi> 29.23. <hi>Vatablus</hi> readeth it, <hi>Exaltabiſ<expan>

The ſignification is good and proper, if it were grounded on Scripture, which it is not. That the heaving up of the offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring did manifeſt It appertaineth to God, is a faire reſultance; but though <hi>Rabbi Solomon,</hi> and <hi>Vatablus</hi> after him, may ſafely conclude, it was moved or ſhaken round about, yet which quarter of heaven they began at, and which they ended at, wanteth proofe: and the Rabbins differ in judgement one from another.</p>
                        <p>I will not ſay, but it is poſſible, Chriſt at the Benediction, might uſe Eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; in ſignification that he ſhould be Lifted up to the Croſſe: yea, waving of the bread in the ſight of his Apoſtles: and toward them, or toward heaven: and if he did, he did it with a divine ſignification, that God commanded this, and that this ordinance was from heaven, perhaps with more than one onely. But it ſeemeth not probable to me, that when and where he abrogated part of the Leviticall Law; Then and There he uſed the Ceremony of the ſaid Leviticall Law: or that his Offering was not every way perfecter than the Oblations of the Old Law, which ſavoured more of the Terreſtriall than Celeſtiall Canaan. <hi>Sed quiſ<expan>

                        <p>WHen Chriſt had Taken the bread, he Bleſſed it, He Gave thankes, He Brake it. His Breaking of it is now to be conſidered. If the Prieſt alone had been to take it, there needed little breaking: or rather none, unleſſe the Prieſt are all the broken pieces. The Breaking implieth it is ſo done for more than one: and for this end was <hi>Fractio panis;</hi> The Breaking of bread.</p>
                        <p>It is ridiculous, what is in <hi>Maldonate,</hi> Matth. 26.26. on the word <hi>Fregit;</hi> It is called the Breaking of Bread; not becauſe it is truely Broken; but becauſe it is Given: As if Bread could not be Broken, and yet not Given. As if they could not alſo Give whole loaves. Did whole loaves, and not rather Broken bread ſignifie Chriſts body, which was Broken for us? And did not Chriſt Give his Diſciples the Sacred Bread after it was Broken? How then is Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all one with Giving? He ſaith, our reaſoning proceedeth from great Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Judge (Reader) if this ſupervice expoſition doe not ariſe from pride, and preſumptive confidence, that he can caſt duſt, and blinde the eyes of the world.</p>
                        <p>Even in this particular alſo, it ſeemeth Chriſt followed the Hebrew cuſtome: For the Talmudiſts report, that at their Home-feaſts among the Jewes, the Head or Father of the Family, Tooke Bread, Gave Thankes, and Brake it.</p>
                        <p>And in truth, Breaking had a proper ſignification to demonſtrate That his Body ſhould be Broken on the Croſſe. For though a <hi>Bone of him was not Broken, John</hi> 19.36. yet were they Out of joynt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.14. yet his Fleſh was Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in many pieces. His holy Temples and Head pierced with many thornes: thornes beate in with a Reede or Cane, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.30. His tender backe ſo cruelly whipped, that the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 129.3. compareth the executioners to ploughmen: the dints, ruptures, and ſlices, made by the Roman rods, to no leſſe than furrowes, than long furrows. <hi>The ploughers plowed upon my backe, and made long furrowes.</hi> I know no interpretation of this Scripture ſo proper as this, that I have delivered. His innocent hands and feete, they bored thorough with great vaſt nayles, ſo great, that a bridle was made of them, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> records. The Pſalmiſt ſayth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. verſ. 16. <hi>They Digged my hands and my feet:</hi> as the Hebrew well beareth it, intimating the wide orifices of the wounds: Laſtly, ſo great an hole was made in his ſide, that <hi>Thomas thruſt his hand into it,</hi> Joh. 20.27. in ſigne of theſe Breakings, well might he Breake the Bread.</p>
                        <p>The word of <hi>Breaking,</hi> ſheweth the ancient cuſtome of Imparting the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the By-ſtanders; And it was Broken by the Hand of the Breaker: or rather with a Knife (ſaith <hi>Lorinus</hi> on <hi>Act.</hi> 2.) becauſe unleavened bread is glu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous, or clammy; and ſo is eaſier divided. That a Knife ſhall be ſaid ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pely to Breake bread, as an Hand, I cannot beleeve. And I diſcerne no ſuch clammineſſe, or cleaving of the Unleavened Bread, above the Leavened, as ſhould cauſe a Knife to be uſed, rather than an Hand: and the Hand may eaſily enough divide it. And if the Knife did prepare it, yet the often repeated word of <hi>Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> induceth me to think, the Fingers did Breake the divided Bread into leſſe and fit pieces. But <hi>Lorinus</hi> brings in that invention of the Knife, and preferreth it before the Breaking with the Hand, contrary to three Evangeliſts, and S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who name not Cutting, but Breaking of bread: Nor doe the ancient Fathers name the Cutting, but urge the Breaking. And when Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Doe this;</hi> It is as cleare as the light of the Sunne, he meaned, <hi>Take the bread, Give thankes, Breake it, &amp;c.</hi> And ſo the not Breaking of the Bread is a trangreſſion of the firſt Inſtitution.</p>
                        <p>How ill then doth the Church of Rome, to leave off Breaking of the Bread (as it hath done for a long time) and to conſecrate <hi>Singulos panes, ſeu minores ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtias, ad vitandum periculum decidentium micarum;</hi> the loaves by themſelves, or
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:47497:240"/>leſſer hoſtes, or ſacrifices, to avoyd the danger of the crumbes falling downe; and that the Laicks and other ſacred Adminiſtrants muſt be contented with a leſſer hoſt than the ſacrificer hath, (ſaith <hi>Lorinus;</hi>) Yet Chriſt Brake the Bread, without feare of crumbes falling, ſay I: and the Primitive Church appointed men to receive the ſacred bread into their Right hands, with their fingers cloſe and not open, and the women to receive it in cleane Linnen, ſo to prevent the falling of the crumbes.</p>
                        <p>Likewiſe concerning the ſacred Wine: The Laicks were wont of old, <hi>Cannâ haurire Dominicum ſanguinem è calice,</hi> with a Cane to drink out of a Chalice the Blood of our Lord: (and ſo was no danger of ſpilling one drop.) <hi>Pellican</hi> calleth it, <hi>argenteum calicem, &amp; Fiſiulam quâ Laici Dominicum exorbeant ſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem.</hi> A ſilver Mazor, or Cup, or Chalice, and a Pipe, Reed or Cane, by which the Laicks ſucked, and ſupped the Blood of our Lord. See <hi>Beatus Rhenanus</hi> in his preface before <hi>Tertullian de Corona Militis;</hi> and <hi>Tertullians</hi> teſtimony in his book <hi>de Corona Militis,</hi> is expreſſe, that they had a great care of the ſacred My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries. <hi>Calicis, aut Panis etiam noſtri aliquid decutian terram, Anxiè patimur;</hi> We are ſoretroubled, and paſſionately ſuffer if one drop of the ſacred Wine or one crumb of ſacred Bread fall to the ground. Which in deſpight of ſome novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, I will apply to the Sacramentall morſell.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Bucan</hi> in his 48 Common place, <hi>pag.</hi> 658. ſeemeth to ſlubber the matter over, thus, <hi>Si in terram forte cadat per imprudentiam, vel mica panis, vel vini gutta, non amplius Sacramenti rationem habet:</hi> If by chance there fall to the ground a crumb of bread, or drop of wine, it leaveth off to bee part of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                        <p>Further obſerve, that the Papiſts have kept away the ſacred wine from the Laity, and now they pare them and mince them, and ſay they muſt be content with a leſſer conſecrated Hoſt, than the Prieſt hath: So that the Laity may feare the Romaniſt will, ere long, take wholly from them the leſſer Hoſt alſo. They ſhall give me leave to think, if they had kept the old Inſtitution; if they had continued in the plaine way: if they had not mingled Policy with Divinity, and preferred gainefull Imaginations, and Worldly Ratiocinations before the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Scriptures, there had never been a Seſſion from that Church.</p>
                        <p>Some think, that to be Broken, is all one with to be Divided. So <hi>Gaspar San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctius</hi> on <hi>Acts</hi> 2. But he is much deceived. For after it was Broken, it was Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: and it might have reſted Broken, and yet Undivided: Undivided to Chriſt himſelfe, or to his Apoſtles: though when it was Broken, it was Divided, one piece from another, and not till it was Broken. Yet he well reſolveth; <hi>Panis hoc loco Frangi dicitur, non Scindi:</hi> it is ſaid to be Broken, not to be Cut or Sli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with a knife. He might have added out of <hi>Baronius</hi> (whom he cited in <hi>Anno Christi,</hi> 8. which ſhould have been 58. <hi>Numero</hi> 64.) that the Rabbin skilfull in Judaicall Antiquities, taught <hi>Baronius,</hi> when the bread was Cut at their Common Feaſts, into ſuch ſhape as hereafter is expreſſed, they did cooke them ſo, that they needed not to Cut them when they ate them, but only to Break them; This is direct againſt <hi>Lorinus</hi> before cited. The forme of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill morſels, at ordinary Feaſts, is thus deſcribed by <hi>Baronius,</hi> not much differing from our March-panes or Sweetmeates cut lozenge-wiſe.</p>

The forme of the <hi>Panis decuſſatus</hi> or bread made in likeneſſe to a Croſſe, or an X, was in this wiſe, as the ſame <hi>Baronius</hi> there hath it, from the old monuments yet to be ſeen.</p>

                        <p>That the good Chriſtians made a religious uſe of this forme, becauſe it did in ſome ſort reſemble a Croſſe, <hi>Gregory</hi> proveth, <hi>Dialogorum</hi> 1.11.</p>
                        <p>Yea even the unleavened bread, of which they made the Euchariſt, was by the Ancients framed to ſuch a quadrangular forme in a Circle, whoſe parts being divided by Breaking, were called morſels. And the Croſſe not only ſtood upon the Altar, (which <hi>Chryſostome</hi> avoucheth:) but alſo was drawn upon the Euchariſt; and afterward on the ſame myſticall bread, Chriſt crucified was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.

                        <p>Let me adde from <hi>Johannes Stephanus Durantus de Ritibus Eccleſiae. cap.</hi> 34. that the holy Euchariſt was kept, and reſerved in a veſſell made in the forme of a Dove, which is a token or badge of Charity, or of the holy Spirit in that wiſe deſcending and lighting upon Chriſt.

                        <p>That the Conſecrated Bread given by Chriſt to his Apoſtles, was unleavened bread, is moſt certaine: To ſay peremptorily, that we may not uſe leavened bread: Or that we muſt uſe leavened bread only, ſavoreth of two extreames: What <hi>Alphonſus de Caſtro</hi> ſaith of the Greek Church, that they are Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, not becauſe they uſed leavened bread in the Sacrament of the Euchariſt: but becauſe they think, that only leavened muſt be uſed; I ſay on the other ſide, If any maintaine that the bread of the Sacrament muſt be only unlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened bread, and that it is ſin to conſecrate any Other bread; I ſhall think him to be in this point little leſſe than a Schiſmatick.

Though at the delivery of the Wine he ſaid, <hi>Drinke yee All of this:</hi> and at the delivery of the Bread, did not ſay <hi>Eat yee all of this:</hi> it is likely he did it for this cauſe, becauſe he gave the Broken bread to every one Himſelfe, by Himſelfe; but they gave the Cup One to the Other (ſaith <hi>Muſculus.</hi>) Yet I hold it far more likely, that as immediately he gave to every one of His A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles the conſecrated bread; ſo he did alſo deliver the Cup to Every one; and was more diſtinct, and punctuall in adminiſtring the Holy Sacrament, than at common refection.

                        <p>Foure times S. <hi>Matthew</hi> nameth Chriſts ſelected company Diſciples; S. <hi>Marke,</hi> Thrice; S. <hi>John,</hi> Thrice; S. <hi>Luke,</hi> Once only, called them Apoſtles: <hi>Luke</hi> 22.14. and Once Diſciples. Now as the once-named word <hi>(Apoſtles)</hi> ſheweth, That the Communicants, were then no part of the Diſciples in General; but thoſe very eſpeciall Twelve or rather Eleven, (<hi>Judas</hi> being gon forth) which were an exempt out from the reſt: employed above the reſt, more inwardly and familiarly converſing with Chriſt, than the reſt of the Diſciples: So ſince they are ſo often called Diſciples, we may think it teacheth us probably, That the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles repreſented at this Euchariſt, in this regard (<hi>viz.</hi> as Chriſt was the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrant) the reſt of the Prieſthood only; not the Body of Chriſts Church; not the whole and intire company of all the Faithfull Diſciples that then were, or were to bee unto the Worlds end: Lay, and others: but the Clergy, Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and Miniſters, who are here called Diſciples: though the word (Diſciples) be alſo often of a larger extent. And this may be a reaſon hereof. No man can imagine that Chriſt gave power to the Laity, and Common Diſciples, Men and Women to conſecrate his Sacred Body and Blood. If they ſhould offer to do ſuch an Act, they ſhould be more guilty than raſh <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah,</hi> who <hi>for but touching the Arke, was ſtroken dead by God,</hi> 2 Sam. 6.7. Than fooliſh <hi>Saul, who for offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a burnt Offering, loſt his Kingdome,</hi> 1 Sam. 13.13. Than preſumptuous <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dab,</hi> and <hi>Abihu, who offered ſtrange fire before the Lord,</hi> Lev. 10.1. <hi>and were conſumed with fire from Heaven.</hi> Than wicked <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> who by raiſing up <hi>two Calves, made Iſrael,</hi> the greateſt Calfe, <hi>to ſin: and made of the lowest of the People Priest of the High places;</hi> now the Calfe was growne to to an Oxe. <hi>Any one that would, or whoſoever would, Jeroboam conſecrated him,</hi> 1 King. 13.33. <hi>which thing became ſin to the houſe of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to deſtroy it, from off the face of the Earth,</hi> verſ. 34. It were an horrid intruſion on Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred offices; and a Nullity in the fact it ſelfe. Not Angels or Archangels, nor any of that Heavenly ſpirituall Hoſt: Not Kings, nor Princes (unleſſe in Orders)
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:47497:241"/>not any under Heaven, except the Clergy, have power to Conſecrate the moſt holy Euchariſt. To whom he ſaid, <hi>Hoc facite;</hi> which he ſaid not to others.</p>
                        <p>Indeed it is true (as is in my Miſcellanies) that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> repreſented ſometimes all the Apoſtles: ſometimes the Apoſtles repreſented all the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy: But in this place toward his death, Chriſt gave his Apoſtles (repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the whole body of the Prieſthood) a power to conſecrate the Sacred Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt; and gave it to them only: So after his Reſurrection, when he had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come actually Death and Sin, Hell and Satan; when he had fully ſatisfied to the utmoſt farthing, for all our offences, and had an over-merit left; even before his Aſcention, he gave again, when he had moſt and propereſt power for to give, to the Apoſtles (repreſenting the Church for ever, that are in holy Orders) another power and authority, diſtinct from the former, yet conducing ſome way to it, in theſe words, John 20.21, &amp;c. <hi>As my Father ſent me, ſo ſend I you. Then hee breathed on them, and ſaid; Receive ye the holy Ghost: Whoſeſoever ſins ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, they are remitted unto them: Whoſeſoever ſins ye retain, they are retained.</hi> Let the ill-bred ignorant Clown jeere at the power of the Keyes, he ſhall never find Heaven gates open, but by theſe Keyes; And to the Clergy only were thy given, maugre all the enemies of the Clergy.</p>
                        <p>In one reſpect it hath been maintained, that the Apoſtles did at the Euchariſt repreſent the body of the Prieſthood; <hi>viz.</hi> as the Sacrament wholly, and only was to be Inſtituted and Conſecrated by them, by whom the Bread muſt bee <hi>Taken, Bleſſed, Broken, Distributed</hi> and <hi>Hallowed,</hi> with the right forme of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration. But in another regard, the Apoſtles, even <hi>Then,</hi> may be ſaid to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the whole company of the Diſciples, in the largeſt ſignification; namely, as <hi>All,</hi> and <hi>Every</hi> Chriſtian was to Receive it: for ſo were <hi>Themſelves, Then,</hi> Recipients; and as Recipients (as well as in other regards Adminiſtrants) were theſe words ſaid to them, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me;</hi> and <hi>All of you drinke of this:</hi> which laſt words cannot be reſtrained to the Miniſters only, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve within their circumference, the whole round World of devout Chriſtians: Elſe none might Communicate but Prieſts only; which to ſay, is accurſed. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I may ſay inoffenſively, Chriſt repreſented the Apoſtles, and ſtood for them, and the body of the Clergy <hi>Idealiter,</hi> when he conſecrated the bleſſed Euchariſt, and gave it to them. But, as Chriſt himſelfe Received it, and in both kindes, he may be called their Sympoſiarchon; and I am ſure, I may ſay truly, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore boldly, Our moſt bleſſed Saviour repreſented the whole body of his univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Church, both Clergy and Lay-people, if ſo he did Receive it, as is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable. In imitation of him, I ſay likewiſe, that the Apoſtles <hi>(quà Apostoli &amp; Sacerdotes)</hi> did celebrate the Divine Myſteries, and Adminiſter them; So, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the Clergy: but as they received the Divine Food, they were Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipants, <hi>(quà Diſcipuli,)</hi> and ſo ſtood in the room of the whole Chriſtian Laity.</p>

                           <hi>Innocencius</hi> the third opined, Chriſt firſt perfected the Euchariſt by Divine power; and Afterwards expreſſed the forme which others ſhould follow. But this is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe againſt the Evangeliſts, who ſay; Chriſt did bleſſe it; which was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome forme of words: yet, in favour of <hi>Innocentius,</hi> he ſaith, The words were ſpoken <hi>Opinativè magis, quàm determinativè.</hi> Rather by way of Opinion, than of determination.</p>
                        <p>Others (quoth he) ſay, the Benediction was made with certaine other words, to us unknown; but he replyeth wiſely; This cannot hold, becauſe our Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Conſecration is now perfected by reciting what was then done: (Let me adde, and <hi>Said</hi> alſo.) And if it were not done by thoſe words, <hi>Then;</hi> it would not be done by theſe words, <hi>Now.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A third ſort ſay, Chriſt ſpake the words of Conſecration twice: Once ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: the ſecond time openly to inſtruct others how to do ſo. But this cannot ſtand; becauſe the Prieſt doth conſecrate, uttering theſe words, as publikely ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by Chriſt, not in a ſecret Benediction. Whereupon ſince the words have no force, but as Recited by Chriſt, it ſeemeth Chriſt conſecrated the Euchariſt, by manifeſt uttering of them. More he may reade at large in him, who ſo pleaſeth.</p>
                        <p>To conclude, he ſaith not, nor can ſay, that Chriſt himſelfe pronounced this Participle <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>Dicens:</hi> or this Propoſition, <hi>Et Dixit, And Said.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is true, ſuch a Conſecration compounded of his Reception of it into his hands, of Benediction, of Fraction, of Diſtribution, and laſtly of the Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and Operatory words themſelves, cannot handſomely be regiſtred in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, without the Addition, <hi>Saying;</hi> or <hi>And he ſaid:</hi> yet this evinceth not, That Chriſt pronounced thoſe words, or in the conſecration needed to pronounce them, but they are only the convenient, if not neceſſary expreſſions of the Relators.</p>
                        <p>Diverſe think, that Chriſt uſed more words in the Conſecration; and among theſe the learned <hi>Franciſcus Lucas Burgenſis,</hi> on <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.26. <hi>Non est veriſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile, tam paucis verbis Dominum uſum eſſe, quàm ſcribunt Evangelistae.</hi> It is not likely, that Chriſt uſed ſo few words, as the Evangeliſts write. Thus far I agree with him; that whether the Benediction were of God, Chriſt bleſſing God: or a benediction upon the Elementary materials; or of both (as I judge likelieſt:) ſome other words were uſed by Chriſt, not made knowne to us: fit for Chriſt on ſuch an occaſion to ſpeake, not neceſſary for us to know or ſpeak: <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſis</hi> ſcarce probably inſiſteth upon <hi>One.</hi> Of which hereafter.</p>
                        <p>Between Chriſts Offering, and giving the bleſſed bread to his Diſciples, on the one ſide: and the conſummate Conſecration, on the other ſide, Chriſt held out his hand, and reached the bread, and ſaid (not the words <hi>And Said</hi>) <hi>Take ye,</hi> or <hi>Take.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Take.</hi> Some would <hi>Give,</hi> but others will not <hi>Receive;</hi> Thus God would Give much unto Millions of people, if they were willing or prepared to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it. And gifts there are, which come off kindly from the hands of the Donor, yet fall ſhort of the hands of ſuch to whom they were Deſtined, becauſe they clutch their Fiſts, <hi>&amp; ponunt Obicem,</hi> lay a Blocke in the way.</p>
                        <p>Chriſt gave the hallowed bread, not in Promiſe, but in Exhibition: He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to Receive it.</p>
                        <p>When he wiſhed <hi>Thomas to thruſt his hand into Christs ſide,</hi> John 20.27. it is irreligious to think, that <hi>Thomas</hi> diſobeyed, or refuſed to do ſo, though it be not expreſſed.</p>
                        <p>That late Writer was a Foole, who ſaid, the <hi>Holy Baptist</hi> was a foole, for not doing at firſt, as Chriſt willed him. God graunt me to be as humble, and as well accepted by Chriſt, as Saint <hi>John</hi> was, even when Chriſt the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time ſpake to the Baptiſt, and over-ruled him to baptize our Saviour. And let the haughty <hi>German</hi> keep his wiſdom to himſelfe. The Baptiſt was wiſe to Godward; though eſteemed a foole by him.</p>

                           </gap>. And becauſe Taking into ones hand, is more proper than to take it into ones mouth; I reſolve, Chriſt put not the bleſſed Sacrament into their mouths, but into their hands: and they did as they were commanded, that is, Take it: For in the Primitive Church the good Chriſtians received it into their hands.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Tertullian de Coronâ Militis; Euchariſtiae ſacramentum non de aliorum Manu, quàm praeſidentium, ſumimus:</hi> We give it not one to another, but each of us ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it from the hand of him who is ſet over us. And into their hands did they take it at firſt (as <hi>Maldonate</hi> confeſſeth.) And the ſtory in <hi>Cyprians</hi> booke <hi>de Lapſis, pag.</hi> 284. proveth. For one who tooke the bleſſed Sacrament unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, <hi>Cinerem ferre ſe apertis manibus invênit,</hi> found embers in ſtead of it, in his hands, and was not able to handle it, or eate it.</p>
                        <p>When Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Take, Eate,</hi> the taking was with the hand; as the eating was by the mouth; and if the Apoſtles had Taken it from Chriſts hands imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately into their mouths, this one word <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>Eate,</hi> would have ſerved for all: and Chriſt had had no need to ſay, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>Take.</hi> For, from bidding them <hi>Eate,</hi> floweth this ſequell neceſſarily, that they were to receive it into their mouths: ſince otherwiſe they could not eate. Therefore the two words, <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite, Manducate,</hi> are two diverſe commandements to be performed by two diſtinct inſtruments, of Hand and Mouth. Nor otherwiſe to be lawfully adminiſtred (as I judge) unleſſe to ſuch as are too weake and ſicke to receive it with their hands; or have loſt the uſe of their hands; or have no hands at all: Which caſes ſometimes have, and ſometimes againe may fall out; and then the hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed food may be put into the mouths of the Recipients; Otherwiſe, not. For Chriſt did both practiſe it, and command his Church to doe the like. <hi>Doe This, This,</hi> as well as the other things. And therefore the delivery of the heavenly Manna into the hands of the Communicants, is neceſſary, except in the before excepted caſes.</p>
                        <p>Indeed we are not bound to doe whatſoever Chriſt did at the Firſt celebrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; For he did it at night, and but to a few, and with unleavened bread, which are left at liberty to us. But we are bound to follow whatſoever he both did and commanded: as he did in this point. For he both Tooke the bread into his hands, and bidding them Take it, he put the conſecrated bread into their hands: and charged them to doe after the ſame manner.</p>
                        <p>And if we goe to Reaſon, The waſhed hands and lips are as cleane, as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the mouth: and therefore it may be put into their hands, as well as into their mouths. Let humane diſcourſe give way to Authority.</p>

                        <p>When they did Reſerve the Sacrament, and carry it to their houſes, I hope they tooke it not into their Mouths, they carried it not in their Mouths, but tooke it in their Hands.</p>

                           <hi>Maldonate</hi> on <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. confeſſeth it: further proofe needed not. Yet was <hi>Maldonate</hi> too blame to ſay, The ſame Church with better Counſell begins to give the Sacrament not into their hands, but into their mouthes: becauſe there was both more reverence, and leſſe danger. To call that better Counſell which varied from Chriſts Inſtitution, I like not. Nor doth <hi>Maldonats</hi> ſimilitude hold. For, if the Churches are the Euchariſt faſting, varying from Chriſt; yet they had Apoſtolicall Authority to guide them, which the Handleſſe and Mouthleſſe Receivers wanted.</p>
                        <p>Some Reject things really Given, and Tendred. <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.9 <hi>Yee Reject the Commandements of God. Jeremy</hi> 8.9. <hi>Some rejected the Word of the Lord.

                        <p>Remarkably is it ſaid, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.48. <hi>He that rejecteth me, and receiveth-not my words, the ſame Word ſhall judge him at the laſt day.</hi> Rejecting, is expounded by Not-receiving, if it ſignifie not worſe alſo.</p>

                        <p>Yet for all this, I cannot think, but when Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>Take;</hi> they did Take it: and when he ſaid, <hi>Eate;</hi> they did Eate.

                        <p>That Chriſt gave <hi>Judas</hi> a Sop, is cleare, a <hi>dipped Sop,</hi> Joh. 14.26. that <hi>Iudas</hi> received it, I hold as cleare, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.30. <hi>He then having received the Sop, went immediately out.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That <hi>Iudas</hi> did eate it, is not expreſſed, nor ſo cleare. He might poſſibly Take it, and not Eate it, but let it lie on his trencher. Beſides, the Sop beeing given for a <hi>Manifeſto,</hi> that <hi>Iudas</hi> was the onely Traytor, perhaps he was not willing to ſwallow the Diſguſt, as he accompted it, and the Sop alſo. But it may be well anſwered; <hi>Iudas</hi> was ſo ſurprized with the unexpected Offer; his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, wit, and ſenſes ſo clouded: his ſoule amazed with ſuch ariſings, and fumes of his treaſonable plot: in one word, ſo given over to Satan, that what ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man, yea what he himſelfe would have done at another Time, either not Receive, or not Eate, he certainly received, and in likelihood ſwallowed.</p>
                        <p>If the words of Scripture be cloſer followed, and more forcibly urged, That <hi>Iudas</hi> having received the Sop, went out immediately: and therefore he did receive it onely, but not Eate it. I anſwer: The end of his Receiving, was onely to Eate it: and there was no great diſtance of time betweene the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and Eating of the Sop: but he might put his hand to his mouth even al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in an inſtant, or <hi>in tempore penè imperceptibili,</hi> in the twinckling of an eye, and ſwallow, without chewing, a moyſtned, ſoft, little glibbery Sop, that his going out immediately excludeth not his Eating. Beſides, the word <hi>Receive,</hi> may extend, not onely to his Taking of it with his hand, but to the Eating of it alſo. For there is a receiving into Ones mouth: and it is not poſſible to be proved, that <hi>Iudas</hi> did not So receive it, nor Eate it.</p>
                        <p>And it may be well beleeved, becauſe ſo many holy Fathers have declared themſelves to think, He did Eate the Sop. I know but few that deny it; but many affirme it. Some indeed ſay, He carried away the Sop, and ſhewed it to the High Prieſts, and thence framed a forged accuſation againſt Chriſt: or an excuſe for his own treachery; as if without cauſe he would not have betrayed him. A man having his hidden ſinnes revealed, groweth worſe, and more madd in ſinning: <hi>Per ſcelera ſemper ſceleribus tutum est iter,</hi> ſaid One.</p>

                           <hi>Lucas Brugenſis</hi> on <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. ſaith; That after the word <hi>Eate,</hi> the reaſon was given. And the word <hi>(Enim)</hi> is to be underſtood: Indeed it may well be underſtood, becauſe at the delivery of the Cup, it is expreſſed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.28. <hi>For this is my blood of the new Teſtament:</hi> And yet the ſenſe ſeemeth to me as full, <hi>Take, Eate, This is my Body:</hi> as if it had beene written, <hi>Take, Eate; For this is my Body.</hi> I would not willingly adde any new ſenſe to Scripture, no more than I would diminiſh a letter from it: eſpecially, if, as it is, the ſenſe may be well accepted.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Caroloſtadius</hi> (and never any before him, that I have read of) fancieth; That when Chriſt ſaid theſe words, <hi>This is my Body;</hi> he put his finger to his breaſt, ſhewed himſelfe, and meaned thus: Here ſitteth my Body which ſhall be given for you. This <hi>Sleidan</hi> reporteth in the Fift booke of his Commentaries. And this may ſeeme to favour him; <hi>Jeſus ſaid to the Iewes, Destroy This Temple, and in three dayes I will rayſe it up,</hi> Joh. 2.19. And the holy Apoſtle expoundeth it; <hi>Chriſt ſpake of the temple of his body,</hi> verſe 21. <hi>Tolet</hi> in his Commentary on the place, ſaith; It is certaine, that when Chriſt ſaid, <hi>This temple,</hi> he did by his Geſture, and the motion of his hands, demonſtrate Himſelfe, and pointed not at the materiall Temple built of ſtone; ſo might he here doe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="628" facs="tcp:47497:244"/>
                           <hi>Tolet</hi> his Collection is but probable. For Chriſt might point at either, at neither, but leave them in ſuſpence. Many times did Chriſt uſe verball aequivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, as I have proved in my Miſcellanies; that is, he ſo ſpake, that his words might have a double Conſtruction; though he adhorred mentall Reſervation.</p>
                        <p>Concerning <hi>Caroloſtadius,</hi> I muſt needs ſay, he was one of them, who in thoſe precipitious and whirling times, did ſtrive to rayſe his owne name, by inventing moſt new devices: And this was one of them, which is not ſeconded by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſtian Divines, which I have ſeene; but diſliked by many: For when Chriſt ſaid, <hi>This is my Body, which ſhall be given for you;</hi> (as <hi>Carolostadius</hi> hath it) is as if he pointed at, and did meane his naturall paſſiive body. What did they eate? They did eate none of That body, nor was it Broken, till, after the Celebration of the holy Euchariſt, he did ſuffer. But the holy Scripture hath it in the Preſent tenſe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.19. <hi>This is my Body which Is given for you:</hi> And verſ. 20. <hi>This Cup Is the new Teſtament in my Blood, which Is ſhed for you.</hi> Can you think (O <hi>Carolostadius</hi>) that when he gave them the Cup, he touched his breaſt, and pointed at, and meaned the blood in the veynes, lanes, and hidden al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys of his mortall body? So, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11.24. <hi>This is my body, which Is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for you.</hi> And, <hi>this Cup Is the new Teſtament in my blood,</hi> verſ. 25. Likewiſe <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.28. <hi>This is my Blood which Is ſhed:</hi> and ſo <hi>Mark.</hi> 14.24. For though it be a truth moſt certaine, that Chriſt his naturall body and naturall blood was broken, given, and ſhed afterwards in his Paſſion: yet <hi>Caroloſtadius</hi> was too blame, to change the Tenſe, to invent an imagined geſture of Chriſt, which is impoſſible to be proved.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, to broach a new opinion contrary to all Divines; from which reful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, That they did eate onely bare Bread, but no way the Body of the Lord: and dranke onely the fruit of the Grape; but no way dranke the Blood of the Lord. Indeed the Vulgate hath it, <hi>Frangêtur,</hi> in the Future tenſe; is Shall be broken for you: But it ſtarteth aſide from the Originall. Nor ſtandeth it with ſenſe, reaſon, or example, that the Future is taken for the Preſent tenſe: ſince it is a retrograde courſe againſt nature. But the Preſent tenſe is often uſed for the Future, foreſhewing the infallible certainty of what will, or ſhall come: both in Propheticall, and Evangelicall Writings. <hi>Eſay</hi> 60.1. <hi>The glory of the Lord Is riſen upon thee:</hi> And yet he ſpeaketh of Chriſt, and his comming. And <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.</hi> 22.12. <hi>Behold I come quickly, and my reward is with me:</hi> And Yet he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not, though it were ſaid above fifteene hundred yeares paſſed. But moſt undoubtedly He Shall come quickly: <hi>Celeritate motus,</hi> though not <hi>celeritate tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris,</hi> when he beginneth to come, he ſhall come ſpeedily; though he ſhall not quickly begin to come.</p>

                           <hi>And he tooke the Cup, and gave thankes, and gave it to them, ſaying, Drinkeyee All of it; for this is my blood of the New Teſtament, which is ſhed for many, for the remiſſion of ſinnes:</hi> Matth. 26.27. &amp;c. It is thus changed; <hi>Mark.</hi> 14.23. <hi>He gave it to them; and They all dranke of it.</hi> And S. <hi>Mark</hi> leaves out theſe words, <hi>For the remiſſion of ſinnes.</hi> S. <hi>Luke</hi> maketh the alteration, thus; <hi>Likewiſe alſo (he gave them) the Cup after Supper, ſaying; This Cup is the New Teſtament In my blood, which is ſhed for You,</hi> Luk. 22.20.</p>
                        <p>Another diverſity is yet, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11.25. <hi>Likewiſe after Supper (he tooke) the Cup, when he had ſupped, ſaying; This Cup is the new teſtament In my blood: This doe yee, as oft as yee drinke it, in remembrance of mee.</hi> Matth. 26.29. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I will not drinke henceforth of the fruit of the Vine:</hi> And this was After the
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:47497:244"/>ſacred Supper. But (ſaith <hi>Adam Contzen</hi>) <hi>A Matthaeo non ſuo ordine ad finem coenae recitantur ea verba de Genimine vitis.</hi> S. <hi>Matthew</hi> reciteth not in Order the words concerning the fruit of the Vine; nor were they ſpoken After Supper. Perhaps (ſay I) they were ſpoken Twice.</p>
                        <p>Here (if ever) is an ample field to expatiate in; theſe words have tortured the wits of the learnedſt men ſince the dayes of the Apoſtles; <hi>Et adhuc ſub judice lis eſt;</hi> And yet they are not determined. And as the Areopagites in an inexpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable perplexity, deferred the finall determination till the laſt day; ſo the Roman Church might have deferred their definitive ſentence, and over-hard cenſure, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven till then; eſpecially ſince they confeſſe, that the manner of Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is inenarrable. Whereupon I am reſolved, to forbeare farther diſquiſition, and to loſe my ſelfe in holy devotion and admiration, that I may find my Chriſt. The ſayle is to large for my boat: This Sea is too tempeſtuous for my Shallop: The new Cut of <hi>Eraſmus Sarcerius</hi> in his <hi>Scholia,</hi> on the place of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> thus ſhuffleth it. The Materiall cauſes are Bread and Wine, and the things under them underſtood, and preſent, the Body and Blood. The Formal cauſes, are to Eat, and to Drink. The Efficient cauſes; Chriſt, who did inſtitute it: and his Word. The Effectuall cauſes, to have Remiſſion of ſins. I ſay, this may rather go among the finall cauſes. And to make Effects to be Effectuall cauſes, introduceth new Logick, new Termes into Logick: Beſides, he omitteth the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall cauſe, which is the firſt mover to the reſt. Divinity and the myſteries of it are not to bow down to any ones Logick.</p>
                        <p>Oh! but will you now ſay leus in the laſt Act? in the laſt Scene? Will you be ſilent, where he and ſhe Apprentices, where Women and illiterate Tradeſmen rayſe themſelves upon their ſtartups, prick up their eares, and tyre their tongues?</p>
                        <p n="1">1. I anſwer, If I ſhould enter into the liſts of controverſie, and take upon me to decide and determine all the doubts, which concerne the holy Sacrament of the Euchariſt; and to untye all the knots, which may be made from thoſe words, I am perſwaded, you might, ſooner ſee an end of me, than I of this Work. For I am wearied, and tyred already. This toyle, which I have performed, and the labour which I have beſtowed, hath coſt me full deare: My ſedentary life hath made my reines as quarries of ſtones; my parents knew no ſuch diſeaſe, though they lived long: my right hand heretofore careleſly unfenced and undefended from the cold (alas for the time!) hath ſwelled with the gowt, as if it would break; I have been often ſick, always weak, yet have I prevented <hi>antelucanam opificum induſtriam; &amp; nox ad diem acceſſit:</hi> Early, and late have I performed my hard taske. Yea Midnight hath conceived full many of the dayes expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and oft have I aroſe from my bed, and meales with a <hi>Concluſum eſt,</hi> to prevent forgetfulneſſe. But the manifold avocations by my own private affaires, and eſpecially by publick employements, both in Eccleſiaſticall, and Civill Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, have, after their diſpatch, ſet an edge, and ſharpned the appetite of my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. The unbent bow hath prepared it ſelfe for the ſtronger ſhooting, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery: Yet now my ſenſes decay; my memory faileth me; I have no courage or incouragement; I am out of heart: I am worne to the ſtumps, and ſpent: I muſt imitate old <hi>Ennius</hi> his race-horſe, to whom age afforded quiet, and exempted from more active exerciſe: craving pardon, if my book in ſome paſſages have par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken of my weakneſſe, and infirmities, or languiſhing. And now, thou great Work of mine, concerning the Eſtate of humane ſoules from their creation to the day of the generall Judgement excluſively: on which I have beſtowed thouſands of houres; Lie ſtill and ſleep. S. <hi>Hierom</hi> did ſeeme always to heare, <hi>Surgite Mortui, &amp; venite ad Judicium.</hi> Ariſe you dead, and come to Judgement. And me thinks, I heare the repeated precept, as ſpoken to my ſelfe, and ſuch only as are in my caſe. 1 Theſſ. 5.17. <hi>pray without ceaſing: pray always,</hi> Luke 21.3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>. Yea though I be enfeebled and faint, wronged and diſtreſſed, as the widow was;
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:47497:245"/>yet the rather ought I alwayes pray, and not faint, <hi>Luke,</hi> 18.1.</p>
                        <p>The very Mcores of <hi>Morocco</hi> pray ſix times in 24. houres; And thinck he is not held worthy to beare witneſſe to a truth, who hath not ſaid his prayers ſix times in a naturall day. Seven times a <hi>day did David prayſe God,</hi> Pſal. 119. verſ. 164. Some have held; and ſure that Chriſtian doth beſt, who ſaith the Lords Prayer at leaſt ſeven times in a day. There never was compoſed a perfecter and ſweeter prayer. To what prayer ſhall God give eare, if not to the prayer compoſed by his own ſon? which the extravagant bablings of Phariſees and battologies of thoſe, who <hi>Longum precantur,</hi> love long prayers (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> phraſeth it:) and the ſudden extemporary ebullitions of Lip-holy ſeeme-Saints are as far inferior, as Hell is to Heaven: which no men, no raptures of Angels or Archangels can mend.</p>
                        <p>O Lord, prepare my heart to continue in Prayers; and guide my prayers to pleaſe thee, through him, in whom thou art well pleaſed, Jeſus Chriſt our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour and Redeemer.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. I will go briefly to work. Concerning the diviſions of theſe times, and the ſcruples from theſe words, I wholly put them off to the Maſters of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, and the <hi>Anti-Bellarminian</hi> Canvaſers: and I refer my ſelfe and my beliefe to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> aſſenting to her wholly, ſo far as my knowledge reacheth: and in other things, beyond my capacity, implicitly beleeving in her.</p>
                        <p>For I ſee no reaſon but in ſuch things, as the Lay-man and Ignorant muſt truſt in his Prieſt, by an implicit Faith: ſo the Clergy man ought to truſt in his Church. It is no falſe ground (whatſoever the ignorant Zelotes do ſay, or write) but fit to be imbraced; To confeſſe and follow Scripture expreſſe, in things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, and to beleeve ſuch ſenſes thereof as may be, though to us unrevealed. Not can it be amiſſe to ſubſcribe to our Church in points beyond our Sphere, Needle or Compaſſe, but to Follow the Faith of our Governors, Overſeers and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors.</p>
                        <p>That which I know, is good; what I know not, I beleeve to be better, ſaid <hi>Heraclitus</hi> of old. To her I ſubject, in humbleſt manner, all my Writings, with my ſelfe: profeſſing in the ſight of God (who ſearcheth ſoules, and tryeth conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences) that I beleeve the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be the pureſt part of Chriſts Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Church:—<hi>pro quâ non metuam mori,</hi> as one ſaid, in another caſe. In the defence whereof I could be well content, if occaſion ſerved, to ſactifice my deareſt blood.</p>
                        <p>In a more particular expreſſing, I unboſome my thoughts thus. We have had foure right Reverend and moſt learned Lords Biſhops. Biſhop <hi>Jewel,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Andrewes,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Morton,</hi> and Biſhop <hi>White,</hi> who have written polemically and unanſwerably of this ſubject; and may give content to any indifferent Reader. Many other Heroës of our Church of <hi>England,</hi> have alſo done excellently well; but the incomparable Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> exceeds them all. Let them, who have him not, buy him: who have him, ſtudy him: and who is ſcrupulous concerning theſe words, <hi>This is my Body, &amp;c.</hi> let him reade, and diligently conſider, and he may ſafely beleeve what Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> writeth in his <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Polity, lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Par.</hi> 67. I cannot but tranſcribe part. Thus then divinely he proceedeth, <hi>p.</hi> 179.</p>
                        <p>Variety of Judgements and opinions argueth obſcurity in thoſe things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about they differ. But that which all parts receive for truth, that which every one having ſifted, is by no one denied or doubted of, muſt needs bee matter of infallible certainty. Whereas therefore there are but three expoſitions made of <hi>This is my Body.</hi> The firſt, This is in it ſelfe before participation <hi>really, and truly the naturall ſubſtance of my body by reaſon of the coëxiſtence, which my omnipotent body hath with the ſanctified element of bread; which is the</hi> Lutherans <hi>interpretation.</hi> The ſecond; This is in it ſelfe and before participation, <hi>the very true and naturall ſubſtance of my body, by force of that
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:47497:245"/>Deity which with the words of Conſecration aboliſheth the ſubſtance of bread, and ſubſtituteth in the place thereof my body; which is the Popiſh conſtruction:</hi> The laſt, <hi>This hallowed Food, through concurrence of divine power, is in verity and truth, unto Faithfull receivers, inſtrumentally a cauſe of that myſticall participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby as I make my ſelfe wholy theirs, ſo I give them in hand an actuall poſſeſsion of all ſuch ſaving grace, as my ſacrificed body can yeeld, and as their ſoules do preſently need, this is to them, and in them, my body.</hi> Of theſe three rehearſed Interpretations the Laſt hath in it nothing, but what the reſt do all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, and acknowledge to be moſt true; nothing, but that which the words of Chriſt are on all ſides confeſt to inforce; nothing, but that which the Church of God hath always thought neceſſary; nothing, but that which alone is ſufficient for vvery Chriſtian man to beleeve concerning the uſe, and force of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; finally, nothing, but that wherewith the writings of all Antiquity are conſonant, and all Chriſtian Confeſſions agreeable. And as truth in what kinde ſoever, is by no kinde of truth gain-faid; ſo the mind which reſteth it ſelfe on this, is never troubled with thoſe perplexities, which the other do both find by meanes of ſo great contradiction between their opinions, and true principles of reaſon grounded upon experience, nature, and ſenſe. Which albeit with boyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous courage and breath they ſeeme oftentimes to blow away, yet who ſo obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth how again they labour, and ſweat by ſubtilty of wit, to make ſome ſhow of agreement between their peculiar conceits and the generall Edicts of Nature, muſt needs perceive they ſtruggle with that which they cannot fully maſter. Beſides, ſith of that which is proper to themſelves, their diſcourſes are hungry, and unpleaſant, full of tedious and irkſome labour, heartleſſe, and hitherto without fruit; on the other ſide, reade we them, or heare we others, be they of our own, or of ancienter times, to what part ſoever they be thought to incline, touching that whereof there is controverſie: yet in this, where they all ſpeak but one thing, their diſcourſes are heavenly, their words ſweet as the Hony-comb, their tongues melodiouſly tuned inſtruments, their ſentences meere conſolation and joy; are we not hereby almoſt even with voyce from Heaven admoniſhed which wee may ſafelieſt cleave unto? He which hath ſaid of the one Sacrament, <hi>Waſh and be cleane;</hi> hath ſaid concerning the other likewiſe, <hi>Eat and live.</hi> If therefore without any ſuch particular and ſolemne warrant as this is, that poore diſtreſſed woman com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming unto Chriſt for health, could ſo conſtantly reſolve her ſelfe, <hi>May I but touch the skirt of his garment, I ſhall be whole;</hi> what moveth us to argue of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, how life ſhould come by bread; our duty being here but to take what is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and moſt aſſuredly to reſt perſwaded of this, that can we but Eat, we are ſafe? When I behold with mine eyes ſome ſmall and ſcarce diſcernable graine or ſeed whereof Nature maketh promiſe that a tree ſhall come; and when after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of that tree any skilfull artificer undertaketh to frame ſome exquiſite and curious work, I look for the event, I move no queſtion about performance either of the one, or of the other. Shall I ſimply credit Nature in things Naturall? Shall I in things artificiall relye my ſelfe on Art, never offering to make doubt? and in that which is alone both Art and Nature, refuſe to beleeve the Author of both, except he acquaint me with his ways, and lay the ſecret of his skill before me? where God himſelfe doth ſpeak thoſe things, which either for height and ſublimity of matter, or elſe for ſecrecy of performance we are not able to reach unto: as we may be ignorant without danger, ſo it can be no diſgrace to confeſſe we are ignorant. Such as love piety, will as much as in them lyeth, know all things that God commandeth, but eſpecially the duties of ſervice which they owe to God. As for his dark, and hidden works, they prefer, as becommeth them in ſuch caſes, ſimplicity of Faith before that knowledge, which curiouſly ſifting what it ſhould adore, and diſputing too boldly of that which the wit of man cannot ſearch, chilleth for the moſt part all warmth of zeale, and bringeth ſoundneſſe of beleife many times into great hazard.

In the Primitive Church, they baptized not any except the Sick, but at Eaſter and Whitſontide. The newly baptized ſtood, to expreſſe their Thankefulneſſe to God for their baptiſme. The people in ſome Churches Stood praying at the Altar (on every Sunday between Eaſter, and Whitſontide) in remembrance of Chriſts Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.

In the Primitive Church when they received the Sacrament Standing Kneeling they Prayed Standing. Kneeling.

The loweſt humiliation is too little for the houſe of God.

Diverſe exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Proſtration and Geniculation, both out of the Old, and New Teſtament.

By Kneeling we ſooner obtaine what we aske at the hands of God. Not lawfull for Any to ſit in the porch of the Temple, but onely the Kings of <hi>Davids</hi> loynes.

                        <p>The Primitive Church Kneeled to the Altars. Altars the ſeats of the body and blood of Christ.

                        <p>It is a cuſtome among many of us, when we receive a courteſie of an high nature from our Superiors whom we reverence, we kiſſe our Right hand firſt, and Then receive it.

                        <p>But if he reprove them for ſitting after prayer, would he not much more have cenſured them, if during their prayers they had ſate?

                        <p>COngruentiall reaſons hereof doe follow.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, To moſt ſacred things moſt ſacred reverence is to be exhibited. But the bleſſed Euchariſt was, and is a moſt divine gift; and kneeling is a ſacred re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence. Therefore was it received with kneeling. The greateſt care is to be had of heavenly matters.</p>
                        <p>This is confirmed by <hi>Tertullian in lib.</hi> 1. <hi>ad uxorem. Saecularibus ſatis agentes ſumus, &amp; utrique noſtrum conſultum volumus; ſi talibus tabulas</hi> (as <hi>Rigaltius</hi> well readeth it) <hi>ordinamus: cur non magis de divinis atque coeleſtibus poſteritati noſtrae proſpicere debeamus?</hi> We are wiſe enough in worldly buſineſſes, and will looke well enough to our ſelves; and make our Wills and Teſtaments concerning theſe lower and meaner affairs: why then ought we not rather to provide for poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in things divine and heavenly?</p>
                        <p>Secondly, The Fathers of the Primitive Church received the holy myſteries with kneeling; And though the true Geniculation be of the mind, ſo that one were better to have an humbled minde, and ſtand upright; than to kneele often, and be proud withall: yet if we worſhip God in our hearts, our hearts will command the humble Bowing of the knees. Beſides, <hi>Geniculatio corporis aedificat ſimplices;</hi> the bodily kneeling doth edifie the ſimple. Therefore <hi>Moris Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtici eſt Chriſto genuflectere,</hi> ſaith <hi>Hierom</hi> on <hi>Eſay</hi> 45. It is an Eccleſiaſticall cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, to Bend the Knees (when Chriſt is named.)</p>
                        <p>When the Corinthians did meete at the receiving of the Euchariſt, wee may ſafely pronounce, they lay not on Beds: but, as they might Sit at their feaſts of Charity; ſo we may preſume, they kneeled when they partaked of the Sacrament.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Rhenanus</hi> in his Annotations before <hi>Tertullian de Coronâ Militis, pag.</hi> 413. <hi>Propter crebram Sacramentorum tractationem, inolita fuit illis religio quaedam, etiam vulgarem panem &amp; vulgare poculum reverenter tractandi:</hi> They were ſo religious when they tooke the Sacrament, that they did transferre ſome reverence alſo even unto their common meats.</p>
                        <p>The fifty-two Injunction of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> commandeth her people to make a lowly courteſie, anſwerable to antiquitie, which uſed a modeſt and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Bowing of the body. But more of this by and by.</p>
                        <p>Yea, the Prieſts were wont <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>: Three times to bow downe, as it is in <hi>Chryſoſtomes</hi> Liturgy: And the like was appointed to the Lay people in his Homilies. The more devout (as I take it) did Bend and Bow their Bodies very low Thrice, even almoſt to the Earth, which was the Greater Reverence: and the Leſſer Reverence (which was a Bending of the head and ſhoulders one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) they performed Twelve times; as a late learned Writer affirmeth.</p>
                        <p>If he pick out ſuch kinde of Reverences, in which, by his deſcription, there was no Kneeling, nor Bending of the Knee: He might countenance Genicula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and bring proofes for it. In the worſhip of God, Body and Soule being united together, there ought to be a ſympathy betwixt them. And ſince the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy expecteth to be Lifted up to Heaven hereafter, it muſt Kneele here on Earth. God loveth not half-worſhip: and God will be glorified as well in our Body; as in our Spirit, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 6.20.</p>

                           <hi>Textullian</hi> witneſſeth, That the Penitents did <hi>Adgeniculare,</hi> Kneele downe at the receiving of Abſolution: And indeed, both the Baring of mens heads, and the Kneeling on Bare and Bended Knees, are both of them geſtures of hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and mortified minds, worſhipping God. Not-Kneeling and coveted heads argue mens pride.</p>
                        <p>The Ancients were wont with Bended Knees, piouſly to worſhip God, except from Eaſter to Whitſontide, ſaith <hi>Tertullian.</hi> And on the Lords day we accompt it unlawfull to faſt, or <hi>geniculis adorare,</hi> to Kneele.

For Hiſtories make it plaine, that diverſe of thoſe holier times, had knees as hard as horne, by their often and continued praying in that geſture. Therefore let ſuch deluded Pure-trants, who come into the Church, as if they had no joynts, as if they had ſwallowed two barrs of iron, or as if two ſtakes were falne into their legges, ſo that they will not, or as if they could not ſtoope, learne more piety and devotion: and not deny That Reverence to God, which they give to temporall Princes.</p>

                        <p>IF any aske the reaſons, why thoſe Primitive devout Ones, did forbeare Knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling betwixt Eaſter and Whitſontide? I anſwer. Firſt, the Church did ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point it: and they were the obedient children of the Church, and would not teach their Teachers, or ſpirituall Fathers. When our Church commandeth thee ſo to doe, doe ſo. Yea but why did the Church appoint it ſo? I ſay, they might have, and I beleeve they had many powerfull Reaſons inducing them Then ſo to doe, which we know not now. I anſwer ſecondly; This might be one Inductive; Becauſe it was fit the people ſhould ſhew themſelves Thankfull for the great and bleſſed gift of Baptiſme, which at Eaſter and Pentecoſt they received moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly: For it ſeemeth, as the newly-baptized waſhed not for a whole weeke after ſacred Baptiſme, and did weare onely White clothes; whence the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day called <hi>Dominica in Albis,</hi> or Whitſonday, had its denomination: Which Ceremonies had their faire ſignifications: So the Church of the Newly-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, gave God Thankes for the Remiſſion of their finnes, and the grace conferred on them by Baptiſme, Standing rather than Kneeling; as may be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from <hi>Rhenanus:</hi> His words are theſe in his Annotations before <hi>Tertullian de Coronâ Militis: Geniculari in adorando, velut poenitentis eſt: Quiſtans adorat, tanquam jam veniam conſecutus, Gratias agit:</hi> In the worſhip of God, Kneeling is the ſigne of a Supplicant or ſuppliant, or as it were of a Penitent: Who worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped God ſtanding, giveth Thankes, as having then received pardon of his ſinnes. When any of our un-kneeling Schiſmaticks are new-baptized (as none are:) Or if they have not ſinned againe ſince the forgiveneſſe of their ſinnes; or if they need no pardon: Or if they were ſo holy every way, as the Primitive Church was, we will indulge ſomewhat unto them.</p>
                        <p>And let them conſider whether <hi>Tertullian,</hi> or other Fathers did not ſpeake in the perſons of the Newly-baptized onely, and repreſented them, when they pleaded the priviledge of Standing, and not Kneeling, at ſome certaine times. <hi>Tertullian de Coronâ Militis, cap.</hi> 3. From the day of Baptiſme we abſtaine a whole weeke, <hi>Lavacro quotidiano,</hi> From our daily waſhing. For, as I dare ſay, that diverſe Churches did Faſt on the Lords day, and others Feaſted on it: whence <hi>Ambroſe</hi> gave the Counſell, and <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> both himſelfe, and his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther practiſed it, and counſelled it to others, that people ſhould faſt or not faſt, according to the cuſtome of thoſe Churches, to which they then came: and with whom they converſed. See <hi>Auguſtine Epiſt.</hi> 118. <hi>ad Ianuar.</hi> So the Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing betweene Eaſter and Whitſontide was not in uſe with All the Primitive
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:47497:249"/>Churches, nor with All the people. The Councell of Nice (the firſt Generall Councell) confeſſed, That ſome did Kneele on the Lords day betweene Eaſter and Pentecoſt, and forbad them; and if any other people did, as the New-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed did, they did it to countenance the neophyte. Chriſtians, rather than as if it were neceſſary: but in ſome times, places, and with ſome people onely.</p>
                        <p>See <hi>Cerda</hi> on <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and he aſſureth us, that of old in the Church, they baptized not any except the ſicke, but at thoſe Two ſolemne times, or Feaſts of Eaſter and Pentecoſt: and therefore all That time they did rejoyce. The Church having changed that Conſtitution, and the Cauſe being removed, why are peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple now ſo deſirous to continue the Effect? Certainly, <hi>Tertullian</hi> himſelfe was not to be baptized, nor taſted milke and honey, nor abſtained from waſhing a whole weeke, when he writ thus: We are thrice drowned over head and eares, then we taſte of mingled milke and honey, and from the day of Baptiſme we abſtaine a whole weeke from waſhing: but he ſpeakes in the perſons of the Newly-bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed: <hi>De Coronâ Militis, cap.</hi> 3. So <hi>ibidem,</hi> when he ſaith; They take the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt <hi>antelucanis coetibus,</hi> at their morning-prayers before day; <hi>Nec de aliorum manu quàm praeſidentium;</hi> and that not at the hands of any, but of their chiefe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; he ſpeaketh in the perſon of the Receivers onely, not of the Adminiſtrants. And examine whether he ſpeake not of ſuch onely, as did then firſt of all receive the holy Communion; as well as before he ſpake of the then-Newly-baptized. Examine alſo whether the not-Kneeling on the Lords day was forbade on all Sundayes of the yeare: or on Eaſter-Sunday, and Whitſunday, and the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes between them.</p>
                        <p>If it be objected, that on theſe Sundayes alſo, yea on All the Sundayes of the yeare they forbore Kneeling, which excludeth the reference to the newly-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized. I anſwer, <hi>Sub Iudice lis eſt,</hi> that is more than they can prove; They did not Stand All the time of divine Service in all Churches; or All the time that they were in the Churches; but ſometimes they ſomewhere Sate, ſometimes they Kneeled, ſometimes they did Proſtrate themſelves, as is generally confeſſed. But at the Altar indeed, the people in ſome Churches ſtood; <hi>Stantes oramus, quod eſt ſignum Reſurrectionis;</hi> We pray Standing, becauſe Standing is a reſemblance of the Reſurrection. <hi>

Among the Jewes, none but the Prieſts, or his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants and family, might eate of ſome ſacrifices, or things offered, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Shewbread. But among the Gentiles, on extraordinary Feſtivals and times of joy, they did promiſcuouſly partake of things offered to Idols; except This caſe onely; Whoſoever had ſlaine a man, he might not partake of the Pagan ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced meate, as being reputed holy: and in this caſe it might be ſaid, <hi>Procul, ô pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cul eſte prophani.</hi> Whereupon that Councell forbad the Ethnick Converts to eate of things offered to Idols promiſcuouſly with other meats, leaſt that might breed an exulceration of minde, between the Jewes and Gentiles, if they uſed contrary ceremonies.

After this, S. <hi>Pauls</hi> opinion was asked by the Corinthians, or cauſe given him to explaine his opinion; And becauſe the Corinthians vainely imagined, That an Idoll was ſomething in the world; otherwiſe the meate of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to Idols would be indifferent, and as nothing, like the Idoll it ſelfe: The Apoſtle to remove this ſcandall for a time, in a ſort cancelleth the decree of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, though made by the holy Ghoſt, and the Apoſtles, and ſeemes to deny that the Idoll is any thing; or that which is offered to Idols is any thing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.19. &amp;c. and in plaine tearmes, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 8.4. <hi>As concerning the eating of things offered unto Idols, we know that an Idoll is nothing in the world:</hi> though made of matter, wood, ſtone, braſſe, ſilver, or gold, yet it is nothing, <hi>In genere ſigni relati ad rem ſignificatam,</hi> becauſe the thing ſignified by the Idoll, is nothing; nothing reall in the world.

                           <hi>Julianus</hi> being thus rancountred and undermined, he fell to a countermine, and the rage of that Renegado Emperor ſo increaſed, as <hi>Theodore Hiſtoriae</hi> 3.14. ſaith, At <hi>Antioch</hi> (the then moſt flouriſhing ſeat of Chriſtians) and in other places, he mingled both the fountaines (their then drinking places) with ſome part of the Heathen ſacrifices, and their markets with meats offred unto Idols. In this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſerable eſtate, ſome were ſtarved, rather than they would eat or drink: and queſtionleſſe died moſt holy Martyrs. Other dovout men did eat and drink of the creatures, which were before them, grounding their practiſes on the Apoſtles words, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.25. <hi>Whatſoever is ſold in the Shambles, that eat, making no question for conſcience ſake.</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.3. <hi>Let not him that eateth deſpiſe him that eateth not: and let not him that eateth not, judge him that eateth.</hi> Again, v. 6. <hi>He that eateth, eateth unto the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, eateth not the Lord, and giveth God thankes.</hi> Some may think the Eaters and Drinkers of thoſe mingled waters and meat, did ſin againſt S. <hi>Pauls</hi> directions, becauſe they knew that ſome things were purpoſly offered unto Idols, and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with other meat and drink.</p>
                        <p>But I judge charitably, that they might lawfully eat, becauſe they did not eat the meats <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, As things offered unto Idols: Neither did know which was offered to Idols, which not: and if they had known, they would have refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the things ſacrificed. Yet for all this, S. <hi>Augustin</hi> in his 154, Epiſtle is enough ſevere in this point, ſaying, If a travailer being extreamly hungry, findeth no meat, but ſuch as hath been offered to an Idoll, though no other man be preſent to ſee him eat, yet let him not eat (ſaith he.)</p>
                        <p>Laſtly after this, the Church mitigated the ſeverity in this point. So ſtill, for the good of peace, for the bettering of the Churches eſtate: for avoyding to give offence to the weak brethren: the ſame thing may done, or not done: concealed or revealed; There is nothing that may be omitted without ſin, but muſt be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, rather than the Sin againſt the weak brethren ſhould be incurred. And this I hold to be a ſafe Rule.</p>
                        <p>And now in further anſwer to my learned and laborious Friend, who was a little ſtumbled, becauſe our Church hath commanded Kneeling, when the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church appointed Standing; I ſay, Churches have great power commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them, of which I ſpake at large in my firſt book; Yet now will adde, that though the Church hath eſtabliſhed ſuch and ſuch good Orders: Yet upon abuſes, or other juſt motives, ſhe may <hi>mutare velificationem,</hi> and change the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. And why ſhould any of the people, or any inferior Miniſter take upon them to guide or governe the Churches, or to pry into the Reaſons, and Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Eccleſiaſticall, why the Governers have appointed ſuch obſervances, or have Abrogated them? The meanner ſort are bound to Obedience. The Foot muſt not uſurpe the offices of the Head, or Eyes. <hi>Peter Moulin,</hi> whom <hi>Balzack</hi> compareth to a brave Sea-man, in a ſingle ſmall Brigandine, daring to affront a great Fleet, found fault with ſuch Miniſters of ours, who for a Cap, and a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſe would leave their Miniſtry, and diſobey our Church; profeſſing, that if his King would permit him to preach in <hi>Paris,</hi> though he were enjoyned to do it in a blew Cap, he would be content to do ſo. In honour of Chriſts Reſurrection, and to teſtifie the joy of Chriſtians for that great bleſſing; the holy Church then
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:47497:251"/>forbade Kneeling at ſome times: Now, ſince that irreverence, and contempt hath grown among the people, our Church hath juſtly commanded kneeling in prayer-time.</p>
                        <p>The Fathers eſteemed the day of the Lords Reſurrection to be the firſt day of Chriſt his Joy, after his Paſſions being dolorous; His deſcent into Hell; His vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory over Satan; His aſcent, and His Reſurrection being active, or laborious. Heavineſſe might endure for awhile, but joy commeth in the morning. So the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers joying not ſo much in their own joy, as in Chriſts joy, which on Sunday morning was leaſt clouded, and leaſt annoyed, they made that Day their Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day: and Kneeling being held by them to be a ſymbole of Sorrow, they forbade that ſigne of Sorrow; and Faſting being a token of Humiliation, they forbade That alſo; though ſome Churches did Faſt on That day, as I proved before; and the people of ſome Churches might, and did Kneele.</p>
                        <p>Excellently writeth S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> That is indifferent which is neither good, nor evill: which if you do, you are not the more righteous; or if you leave it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, you are not the leſſe righteous. But if the Supreame Magiſtrate, or the Church command a thing indifferent, it is no longer indifferent to thee; it is now a binding precept upon the injunction: and that muſt make thee yeeld Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon the Eccleſiaſticall Magiſtrates authority, which bindeth not others, in other places.</p>
                        <p>Variety of ceremonies, is not hurtfull to the Church of Chriſt, but rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall; for out of them we may chooſe thoſe for practiſe, which are beſt, and moſt agreeable to our Times and Congregations. If thou findeſt any thing, any where, that more pleaſeth God, ſelect that to the uſe of the Church, ſaith <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, to our <hi>Augustine</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> as it is in <hi>Beda,</hi> cap. 27.</p>
                        <p>What <hi>Gregory</hi> appointed, I wiſh the now Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> practiſed. In all our ſolemne Eccleſiaſticall meetings we begin with publick humble prayer unto God to bleſſe and guid us. Yet in the Popes Conſiſtory at <hi>Rome,</hi> there is not heard the voyce of publick prayer. And the learned Cardinall <hi>Palaeotus De Sacri Conſiſtorii Conſultationibus,</hi> p. 373. goeth about to excuſe it, ſaying; The Pope and the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals were at their Devotions, before they came to the Conſiſtory; and there commended themſelves heartily to God. I anſwer, Every one, I preſume in our Convocation-houſe do pray to God heartily before our going to that meeting: yet publick prayers are alſo thought neceſſary: becauſe of meeting in an holy place; and becauſe holy matters are there to be handled; and we ſeeke to obtaine a bleſſing from God: <hi>and we must not be weary in well-doing,</hi> Gal. 6.9. <hi>but must pray always,</hi> that is upon all faire occaſions.</p>
                        <p>In too too many things, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath followed and imitated the faſhions of <hi>Heathen Rome:</hi> In this point, Pagan <hi>Rome</hi> is holier than our late Chriſtian <hi>Rome.</hi> No man doubteth but the Senators did after their ſort, pray in their Houſes, or Capitoll, or Temples, before they came into the Sentate houſe: yet before they began any buſineſſe of the World, this kind of prayer was publickly recited. <hi>Quod foelix fauſtumque ſit, &amp;c.</hi> God bleſſe and proſper us in our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings.</p>
                        <p>His Second ſubterfuge, that they pray not, becauſe the Pope is preſent, who hath ſo great power, is moſt ridiculous: for ſuppoſing him ſo holy, and to have all the pretended power; He and they ſhould the rather pray together to God, and would the ſooner be heard.</p>
                        <p>I returne to the old matter.</p>
                        <p>Concerning Kneeling at the Receiving of the holy Euchariſt, it was never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked as a thing of its own nature evill and unlawfull, but as inconvenient for ſuch times, and not ſimply inconvenient, but becauſe the Church ſo judged. From Eaſterday not only unto Whitſunday excluding it, <hi>ſed eâdem immunitate in Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſten uſque gaudemus,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tertullian de Coronâ Militis, cap.</hi> 3. They kneeled neither at the feaſt of Eaſter, nor at the feaſt of Pentecoſt, nor between thoſe
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:47497:251"/>times; but after both feaſts were ended. If you look for Scripture to command this: No Scripture preſcribeth it as a Law. Tradition is the author: Cuſtome the confirmator: Faith is the obſerver, ſaith <hi>Tertullian cap.</hi> 4. And there was ſome reaſon for it, to which thou oweſt obedience, ſaith he, <hi>ibid.</hi> Whenſoever they received the bleſſed Sacrament ſtanding, they prayed ſtanding likewiſe: when they Kneeled at one duty, they Kneeled at the other: yet diverſe of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious ones will kneele at Prayer; who will not kneele when they are partakers of the Communion; and are faulty therein, which themſelves find fault withall; contemning the ancient Churches practiſe in the one halfe, whilſt they are eagerly bent for the other part.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, at the firſt inſtitution of things, both ſacred and prophane, the ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is more, than in the ſequell of them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Abraham made a great Feaſt, the ſame day that Iſaac was weaned, Geneſis</hi> 21.8. When Chriſt weaned the Apoſtles from the World, and made them an Heavenly banquet, we muſt think, their Joy and Thankes was great, and their devotion did ſtrive to correſpond unto the gift.</p>
                        <p>At the receiving of the Law, the Iſraelites ſanctified themſelves two dayes, and waſhed their cloaths, and did not come to their wives, <hi>Exodus</hi> 19.14, and 15. yet was the Law but a Schoolmaſter to bring us to Chriſt; and brought not with it that benefit to them, which the ſacred Euchariſt doth to us. Therefore the greateſt and devouteſt ſolemnity of Geſture can be but too little.</p>
                        <p>When Chriſt was in his ſwadling-bands, <hi>The wiſemen fell down, and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped him. Matth.</hi> 2.11. <hi>and gave gifts unto Him.</hi> And can we think the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles lay all along or ſate unreverently, when Chriſt gave Them better gifts than Gold, Franckincenſe, and Myrrhe: when he gave Himſelfe to them? <hi>Abſit;</hi> God forbid.</p>
                        <p>If we have but new cloaths, we will not ſuffer a ſpot upon them: but we wipe them, bruſh them, and put them on, more carefully, than when they are thread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare and worne out.</p>
                        <p>It is an old Proverbe, Every new thing hath a Golden tayle, is much loved, admired and deſired: and yet within awhile, it fals into neglect; and ſometimes into contempt, <hi>&amp; malam caudam trahit,</hi> that I may uſe <hi>Calvins</hi> phraze in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles, <hi>Colum.</hi> 478. it ſmelleth ill, like the candle going out. I have lived to ſee popular Lectures ſinck below ſcorne, who were formerly admired: and both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſervedly, as the humors and paſſions of the people move, which is by Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valtoes.</p>
                        <p>The diſeaſes of the body, and the humors thereof, commonly fall into the legs; all ſins of former times have deſcended and rowled down upon and into our dayes: and now the feet ſwell, and we proud, that they are full of corruption; and a curing hand, they will not heare of.</p>
                        <p>O my God! into what dregs of time are we fallen, that they, who pretend moſt Devotion, and think themſelves to be the pureſt Chriſtians on the earth, do accompt it Indevotion to be humble and reverent, and will not come into the houſe of prayer, till prayer be ended, that they may heare a Sermon? Who will not Kneele, when they enter into the Church, nor ſhew any reverence at their going out of it: nor bow at the ſacred mention of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; but come boldly, impudently and moſt irreverently into Gods houſe, and ſtay there: and returne, as if it were an ordinary roome or Town-houſe to meet in. Is this to reverence Gods Sanctuary? Is the feare of Superſtition become the mother of Atheiſme? Hath liberty been turned into licenciouſneſſe? Becauſe ſome Kneele to Idols, ſhall we not Kneele to the true God? Becauſe ſome creep to the Croſſe, ſhall not wee worſhip, and fall downe, and kneele before the Lord our Maker? This is ſuch a mark of the deare children of God, of the Elect, and the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Juſt, of the Plants for Heaven, of the Holy Ones that are ſure to be ſaved, as former times never heard of. How hath my ſoule abhorred to ſee ſome
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:47497:252"/>men labour to gaine reputation upon God, and by being irreverent in the Church to magnifie themſelves, as they think, above the people; who keep off their hats whilſt the Atheiſts are covered, and kneele, whilſt they moſt profanely do ſit. The loweſt humiliation is too little in that ſacred place.</p>
                        <p>They cried before <hi>Joſeph; Abrech</hi> or <hi>bow the Knee,</hi> Gen. 41.45. Eſay 46.23 <hi>I have ſworne by my ſelfe: the word is gone out of my mouth in righteouſneſſe, and ſhall not returne, that unto mee every knee ſhall bow:</hi> which is explained, That they ſhall Kneele before prayer. <hi>Every knee ſhall bow to me, and Every tongue ſhall ſweare;</hi> or as S. <hi>Paul</hi> Roman. 14.11. expoundeth it, <hi>Every tongue ſhall confeſſe to God.</hi>

                        <p>The Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 2.9. enlargeth it thus; <hi>God hath highly exalted Chriſt, and given him a name, which is above every name: that at the Name of Jeſus every Knee ſhall bow, of things in Heaven, of things in Earth, and things under the Earth.</hi>

To argue from the abuſe, to the wholly removing of things in their right uſe, is as childiſh and ridiculous, as if another ſhould ſay, The Vines and the Corne are to be ſpoyled and cut downe, becauſe ſome are drunke, and doe ſurfet: and all creatures, and all the world to be deſtroyed, becauſe Man abuſeth them; yea mens ſoules and bodies to be anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated, becauſe there are none, but ſometimes and ſome wayes, doe abuſe both their ſoules and bodies.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the veneration of the Sacrament, it is accorded on all ſides, That in the Act of Receiving, or whilſt we are participating of it, it is lawfull to Kneele, yea to fall downe and worſhip Chriſt in it.</p>

And God ſaith, <hi>He will beautifie the place of his Sanctuary, and make the place of his feete glorious,</hi> Eſay 60.13.

                        </p>
                        <p>Did God, when he brought in the Firſt-begotten into the world, ſay, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Let all the Angels of God worſhip him?</hi> And when the ſame Saviour of Ours, was going out of the world, and was preſent with his holy Apoſtles, and gave them his owne Body and Blood with all needfull graces, and among them even this grace, to know <hi>Whom</hi> to adore, and <hi>When</hi> (which are parts of his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip) can we think he was not worſhipped by them?</p>
                        <p>Alwayes <hi>then,</hi> and <hi>everywhere</hi> is Chriſt to be <hi>adored: Fieri nec poteſt, nec debet, quin fides Christum in actione coenae praeſentem veneretur:</hi> It cannot be, nor ought to be, but that our Faith muſt worſhip and adore Chriſt preſent in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall diſtribution and reception.</p>
                        <p>And the ſame <hi>Chemnitius</hi> bringeth in <hi>Auguſtine, Ambroſe, Nazianzen,</hi> and <hi>Euſebius Emiſſenus</hi> for his Co-opinioniſts; yet thus he expounds himſelfe; That not the materiall Elements are to be adored, but Chriſt onely.</p>
                        <p>But my inference and collection from theſe paſſages, is onely this; If we muſt adore Chriſt, when we celebrate and take the divine Sacrament; then it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Apoſtles much more to doe ſo, when They beheld Chriſt, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, viſibly, perſonally, and bodily preſent, conferring thoſe hallowed Bleſſings unto them.</p>
                        <p>I doe not ſay, I doe not thinke, that the Apoſtles did alwayes, at all times, and in all places adore Chriſt, by bodily proſtration, after they knew he was <hi>humanatus-Deus,</hi> the Sonne of God, yea God in our Fleſh. He expected it not. The occaſions did not ſo permit it. He ſent them, He ſate with them, He did eate and drinke ordinary food with them, He waſhed their feete: At which times, bodily adoration was not, could not be well performed. Chriſt held it worſhip enough, at ſome times, that they did confeſſe him to be God and Lord: <hi>My Lord, and my God,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Thomas</hi>) Joh. 20.28. <hi>Thou art Chriſt, the Sonne of the living God,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter,</hi> Matth. 16.16. We beleeve, and are ſure, <hi>Thou art That Christ,</hi> Joh. 6.69. It was well accepted from them, <hi>That they did worſhip him in Spirit and Truth,</hi> Joh. 4.24. If their mindes and ſoules had gotten an habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all adoration of him, the expreſſion of it by continuall proſtration was not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. But firſt when Chriſt had newly performed ſome ſuperhumane workes, they did as they were bound, <hi>Worſhip him,</hi> Matth. 17.6. At the Transfiguration when they heard a voyce from Heaven, <hi>They fell on their faces.</hi> At the great draught of fiſhes, overlading their ſhip, <hi>Peter fell downe at Ieſus knees,</hi> Luk. 5.8. And others might doe ſo, at other times, though it be left unmentioned.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. When they begged great matters, <hi>They worſhipped him.</hi> The woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> ſeeking for helpe, <hi>Worſhipped him,</hi> Matth. 15.25. The mother of <hi>Zebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees</hi> children craving a boone, <hi>Worſhipped him,</hi> Matth. 20.20.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. When Chriſt did actually heale ſome, who were vehemently afflicted, <hi>They did adore him.</hi> The healed Samaritan, <hi>fell downe on his face at Chriſts feete,</hi> Luk. 17.16.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Laſtly, it was fit to adore him, when he extraordinarily conferred on their ſoules greater bleſſings, to the ſaving and inriching them with all neceſſary graces; At ſuch times and ſeaſons, did they, ought they too, Adore him. And thus did he doe to them, when he gave them the conſecrated food of his Body and
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:47497:254"/>Blood, when he inſtituted a new Sacrament for the good of their ſoules. And therefore I doubt not, but they did Then Adore him, according as the excellency of the gift required.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, Kneeling being a Geſture of Piety, as M. <hi>Hooker</hi> fitly tearmeth it, an Adorative Geſture, and above all Geſtures moſt frequent in uſe to worſhip God; I conclude, with ſome degree of certainty, and with the cleereſt probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: That when Chriſt adminiſtred the conſecrated Euchariſt unto his Apoſtles, they Kneeled at leaſt, if they did not fall down on their Faces, and worſhip him.</p>
                        <p>And yet if they did fall down to the Ground, they firſt fell on their Knees: and Kneeling was the way and meanes of their proſtration, and they aroſe not up, without Kneeling.</p>
                        <p>Let any one, give me one inſtance where ever any Church at any time did like or preſcribe, that any one might receive the bleſſed Sacrament of the Euchariſt Sitting, or Lying all along, except ſuch as were unable to kneele, till theſe later times of Singularity, and Innovation, and I ſhall give them thankes.</p>

                        <p>The generall Confeſſion is to be read, both Prieſt and People humbly Kneeling on their knees.</p>
                        <p>The hearty prayer following, conjoyned with the Operatory Abſolution, is to be done by the Prieſt or Biſhop (if he be preſent) ſtanding: and the people kneeling. And in that poſture may continue, till the Laudatory, <hi>with Angels and Archagels</hi> be performed.</p>
                        <p>Then ſhall the Prieſt kneele down praying in the name of all the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants; The people alſo kneeling, and ſaying <hi>Amen</hi> to the prayer. For I do not
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:47497:256"/>remember that ever the Prieſts did kneele, when the people ſtood: but the Prieſts many times ſtand, when the people kneele: As in the words of Prayer and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration following the Prieſt ſtandeth up, and People kneele. When the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter or Miniſters do participate, they kneele. When they Diſtribute, and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to the People, the Prieſts ſtand, the People receive it kneeling, as the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick appointeth.</p>
                        <p>And great reaſon is there people ſhould then kneele, at the Divine prayers, <hi>The Body of our Lord Jeſus Christ which was given for thee, preſerve thy body and ſoule unto everlasting life:</hi> and a like prayer is devoutly powred forth at the delivery of the Cup. And will they not kneele when the heart ſaith <hi>Amen</hi> to theſe holy prayers? It is ſo far from being Idolatrous to kneele before God at theſe prayers, that it is obſtinate Irreverence, Contempt of the Sacrament, yea of Chriſt himſelfe, Not to kneele, for ſuch as are well before inſtructed. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, are we not at that inſtant adviſed to be Thankfull? which ſeldome is well performed without Prayer; and Prayer is to be ſaid, as <hi>with lifting up of holy hands,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.8. ſo moſt wiſe with bending of humbled knees. It was alſo the wicked <hi>Phariſee who ſtood, and prayed,</hi> Luk. 18.11. But <hi>Chriſt himſelfe kneeled down and prayed,</hi> Luk. 22.41.</p>
                        <p>Oh that ſuch wretches, as do beat their ſervants if they be not reverent, humble, but diſreſpect their Maſters, and little eſteeme of their kindneſſes beſtowed, would but make the compariſon between their heavenly Maſter, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                        <p>After the participation ended, every one ſolemnly kneeleth downe on his knees, and ſaith the Lords Prayer. And in that Geſture continue, whilſt they ſay the next prayer, or the next ſave one.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Gloria in excelſis Deo,</hi> by reaſon of the Prayſe, Bleſſing, Adoration, and Thankſgiving included in it, and by reaſon of the Divine prayers made to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Son: with the coequally-glorious holy-Spirit, may well be ſaid, or ſung, All Kneeling.</p>
                        <p>The Bleſſing at their parting, is to be performed by the Biſhop, or Prieſt ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and by the People Kneeling.</p>
                        <p>The Collects after the offertory, are to be read, all parties Kneeling: for every one of them is a powerfull prayer.</p>
                        <p>What the Rubrick directly appoints, ought to be anſwered with full and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient performance: And ſince I have ſpoke my mind in ſome points unſpecia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized, in or by the Rubrick; I ſubmit my judgement, (as I do in all other things) to the judgement of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And thus I proceed.</p>
                        <p>That the people are moſt an end to Kneele, but eſpecially at the Receiving of the holy Communion, is ſo cleare, that all ſee it, except ſuch, whoſe eyes Satan hath blinded. And if they do not repent, he will lead them blindfolded into the Lake of fire and brimſtone, which never ſhall be quenched.</p>

                        <p>THat when the people Kneele, the Miniſter is to deliver the Communion in both kinds into the hands of them, is as cleare.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Maximus</hi> a great enemy of the <hi>Monothelites,</hi> ſaith, All men that will Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, muſt firſt waſh their hands, that with a pure mind, and neat conſcience they may receive the Sacrament. Likewiſe let the Women bring cleane Linnen, that they may receive Chriſts body. <hi>Baronius, Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>Anno.</hi> 5. <hi>Numero</hi> 148. ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth, men might take it into their bare hands. Women might not take it but in Linnen, which was called <hi>Dominicale.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Hence firſt the nicity of former times, may be queſtioned, Why the Women were to receive it in pure linnen, and white: but the Men into their bare hands? Have not the Women as cleane and white hands as Men? If the Womens hands
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:47497:257"/>were unworthy to receive it, how are the Mens hands more worthy? If linnen be to cover, or adorne the Womens hands: Why will not ſuch an ornament befit Mens hands alſo?</p>
                        <p>In the ſixt Synod, <hi>Canone</hi> 3. celebrated <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 681. there ſeemes to be a Plea againſt that cuſtome. We do not admit thoſe who make receptacles of gold, or of other matter, to receive, in ſtead of their hands, the Divine myſteries; for they prefer the liveleſſe ſubject matter before the Image of God. If any do ſo, let both the Adminiſtrant, and the Communicant be ſeparated.</p>
                        <p>Again, it is the faſhion both for Men and Women, to receive the ſacred Bread from the hands of the Miniſter, ſome with the thumb and one finger; ſome with the thumb and two fingers: and this is not ſinfull, nor to be condemned in it ſelfe, as it may be carefully delivered and received. But if any crumb or particle fall to the ground, it is a greater ſin, than people imagine. <hi>Tertullian</hi> took it very grievouſly, when any ſuch thing was. <hi>Origen</hi> accounteth it a ſin, and a great ſin, &amp; told the people they did well to think ſo of ſuch as let any part fall to the ground.</p>
                        <p>The words are; <hi>Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 102. <hi>in Euſebius, Epiſcopius</hi> his edition. <hi>Nostis qui divinis myſteriis intereſſe conſuevistis, quomodo cùm ſuſcipitis Corpus Christi, cum omni cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telâ, &amp; veneratione ſervatis, ne ex eo parum quid decidat, ne conſecrati muneris ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid dilabatur. Reos enim vos creditis, &amp; rectè creditis ſi quid inde per negligentiam de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidat. Circa Corpus Chriſti conſervandum (magnâ) utimini cautelâ, &amp; recte utimini.</hi> You who are uſually preſent at Divine ſervices, do know, with what warineſſe, and reverence you preſerve the Body of Chriſt when you receive the ſame; leaſt by chance ſome ſmall parcell or crumb of the Conſecrated gift, ſhould ſlip out from between your fingers, and fall to the ground. For you do beleeve, and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleeve, that you are guilty of the Body of Chriſt, if any part or parcell thereof ſhould through your negligence fall to the ground. And therefore you do uſe, and rightly uſe, a great deale of cautelouſneſſe in the preſervation of the Body of Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the firſt, who lived in the dayes of <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> between 100, and 200 yeares after Chriſt, puniſhed thoſe by whoſe negligence any of the Lords Blood did fall upon the ground or Altar: The like we imagine of the ſacred Body.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sanctificatis ergo oculis tam ſancti corporis contactu, communica: Cave, ne quid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidat tibi.</hi> The very eyes being ſanctified by the touching of ſo holy a Body: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the bleſſed Euchariſt; but take heed, that no part of it fall from thee, ſaith <hi>Cyril</hi> of Hieruſalem.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Baronius, Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>anno</hi> 75. <hi>Numero</hi> 146, ſaith, that when they took the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt in former times, certaine little Tables were ſet before the Communicants; as now (ſaith he) we hold Linnen cloths before the Receivers.</p>
                        <p>And all this was done, and is done out of doubt, leaſt any particle ſhould fall to the Ground.</p>
                        <p>Indeed, there is more danger in the nice receiving with the thumb, and a finger or two; for the Bread is made of many cornes, and every corne yeelds ſuch mealy ſtuffe, as may eaſily by breaking, or in the acts of delivery, and receiving, moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der into crumbs, and fall down: There is much more care to be had of the keeping whole of ſuch mouldring ſoft food, than if ſilver, gold, or pretious ſtones (from which nothing can drop away) were to be conſigned over, or delivered to others. Nor is there danger in the fall of them; But danger there is in the fall of the Conſecrated Bread.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore I doubt not, but as the words of the Liturgy command not, to put the holy bread into the peoples fingers, or between their thumb and fingers, but into their hands; ſo the meaning is, it ought to be delivered into the palmes of their hands, as a ſafer receite, and as a ſafer conveyer unto their mouths, than the uſe of thumb and fingers.</p>

I proved before, that at the holy Receiving, a prayer is preparatory, and made for every one of us. And as the Miniſter devoutly prayeth, doth not thy heart ſay <hi>Amen?</hi> and is not <hi>Amen</hi> truly explaned and enlarged thus; O Lord, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, this is thy Body, this is thy Blood, yea it is thine own Selfe which thou vouchſafeſt unto me, and I do now Receive: Oh preſerve my body and ſoule un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to everlaſting life; I eat in remembrance that thy Body was broken, and that thou dyedſt for me: I drink in remembrance that thy Blood was ſhed and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out for me. Lord, I am thankfull, and I feed on thee in my heart by Faith. Lord, I beleeve, pardon my wandring thoughts: unite me unto thee: make me from henceforth holy, and conformable to thy ſelfe, and let this ſpirituall food ſtrengthen me in the way to Heaven.

Now, Reader, judge again, if a man will not kneele when the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter prayeth for him, and that openly? If he will not kneele, when he powreth out his hearty prayers unto God, whether he ſinneth not haynouſly? Certainly, God condemneth his fooliſh obſtinacy; and ſo I paſſe to another point.</p>

                        <p>IT followeth in my Method, to inquire what ſpeeches were ſpoken by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour after the Third Supper was adminiſtred. S. <hi>Paul</hi> mentioneth none. The gracious <hi>Sermo Domini in Coenaculo,</hi> was after Supper, after the Third and Laſt Supper; beginning <hi>John</hi> 13.3. continuing to <hi>John</hi> 16.33. Then, as he had made a long Sermon to his Apoſtles, ſo he continueth with a Prayer to God, in part of the ſeventeenth chapter of S. <hi>John.</hi> Then did they ſing an Hymne, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.30 what it was is unknowne. In likelihood, after the Hymne, they departed the houſe; and then fully ended the Third Supper. Then they went over the brooke <hi>Cedron,</hi> over the Mount of <hi>Olives.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>David</hi> when he fled from his unnaturall and rebellious ſon <hi>Abſolon,</hi> went up by the aſcent of Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> and wept as he went up, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.30. No doubt alſo but our Saviours heart was full of ſorrow. For in the way, as he went to the Mount, He foretold <hi>that all the Apoſtles would be offended,</hi> Matth. 26.31, &amp;c. and that <hi>Peter would deny him,</hi> howſoever he promiſed the contrary.</p>
                        <p>Hence in ſome likelihood proceeded the ſtrife, (when S. <hi>Peter</hi> was curbed by our Saviour) <hi>which of them ſhould be accounted the greateſt,</hi> Luke 22.24. Which was determined by Chriſt from the 25 verſe, unto the end of the 30. Though ſome think the ſtrife was at the Second Supper. Whereupon Chriſt to teach them humility, waſhed their feet, and became as their ſervant.</p>
                        <p>When hee came to the Mount, he prayed: When he came down from the Mount, he ſtill had more conference with his Diſciples, and comforted S. <hi>Peter</hi> in ſpeciall, and all the Apoſtles in general. We cannot think, but he paſſed all the time in holy devotions, and heavenly diſcourſes. About halfe an houre before midnight, he came to the village Gethſemane ſituated at the foot of the Mount of <hi>Olives:</hi> and there the Apoſtles did ſit, and ſtay by his command, except <hi>Peter,</hi> and thetwo ſons of <hi>Zebedee,</hi> and they went with Chriſt: <hi>and Chriſt prayed thrice,</hi> Matth. 26.36. Then might he conclude, and ſeale up all with a prayer for his Church, John 17.9. <hi>For when he had ſpoken theſe things,</hi> John 18.1. <hi>Then did he paſſe the brook Cedron, where was a Garden into which he entred, and his Diſciples, as he was wont: &amp; Judas knew the place,</hi> Joh. 18.1. &amp;c. <hi>and Judas came thither,</hi> v. 3. and there was Chriſt betrayed, and bound. From thence was he carried and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried unto manifold examinations, and more revilings: He was hurried to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to ſentence all along the dolorous way to the ſhamefull death of the roſſe.</p>
